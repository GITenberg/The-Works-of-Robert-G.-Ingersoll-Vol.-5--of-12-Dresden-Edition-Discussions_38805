      <br /> <a name="linkPREF" id="linkPREF"></a><br /> <br /> <big><b>PREFACE</b></big><br />
      <br /> SEVERAL people, having read the sermons of<br /> Mr. Talmage in which
      he reviews some of my<br /> lectures, have advised me not to pay the
      slightest<br /> attention to the Brooklyn divine. They think that<br /> no
      new arguments have been brought forward, and<br /> they have even gone so
      far as to say that some of<br /> the best of the old ones have been left
      out.<br /> <br /> After thinking the matter over, I became satisfied<br />
      that my friends were mistaken, that they had been car-<br /> ried away by
      the general current of modern thought,<br /> and were not in a frame of
      mind to feel the force<br /> of the arguments of Mr. Talmage, or to clearly
      see<br /> the candor that characterizes his utterances.<br /> <br /> At the
      first reading, the logic of these sermons does<br /> not impress you. The
      style is of a character calculated<br /> <br /> VI<br /> <br /> to throw the
      searcher after facts and arguments off<br /> his guard. The imagination of
      the preacher is so<br /> lurid; he is so free from the ordinary forms of
      ex-<br /> pression; his statements are so much stranger than<br /> truth,
      and his conclusions so utterly independent of<br /> his premises, that the
      reader is too astonished to<br /> be convinced. Not until I had read with
      great care<br /> the six discourses delivered for my benefit had I any<br />
      clear and well-defined idea of the logical force of<br /> Mr. Talmage. I
      had but little conception of his<br /> candor, was almost totally ignorant
      of his power to<br /> render the simple complex and the plain obscure by<br />
      the mutilation of metaphor and the incoherence<br /> of inspired
      declamation. Neither did I know the<br /> generous accuracy with which he
      states the position<br /> of an opponent, and the fairness he exhibits in a<br />
      religious discussion.<br /> <br /> He has without doubt studied the Bible as
      closely<br /> and critically as he has the works of Buckle and<br /> Darwin,
      and he seems to have paid as much attention<br /> to scientific subjects as
      most theologians. His theory<br /> of light and his views upon geology are
      strikingly<br /> original, and his astronomical theories are certainly as<br />
      profound as practical. If his statements can be relied<br /> upon, he has
      successfully refuted the teachings of<br /> <br /> VII<br /> <br /> Humboldt
      and Haeckel, and exploded the blunders of<br /> Spencer and Tyndall.
      Besides all this, he has the<br /> courage of his convictions&mdash;he does
      not quail before a<br /> fact, and he does not strike his colors even to a
      dem-<br /> onstration. He cares nothing for human experience.<br /> He
      cannot be put down with statistics, nor driven<br /> from his position by
      the certainties of science. He<br /> cares neither for the persistence of
      force, nor the<br /> indestructibility of matter.<br /> <br /> He believes in
      the Bible, and he has the bravery<br /> to defend his belief. In this, he
      proudly stands<br /> almost alone. He knows that the salvation of the<br />
      world depends upon a belief in his creed. He<br /> knows that what are
      called "the sciences" are of<br /> no importance in the other world. He
      clearly sees<br /> that it is better to live and die ignorant here, if you<br />
      can wear a crown of glory hereafter. He knows it<br /> is useless to be
      perfectly familiar with all the sciences<br /> in this world, and then in
      the next "lift up your eyes,<br /> being in torment." He knows, too, that
      God will<br /> not punish any man for denying a fact in science.<br /> A man
      can deny the rotundity of the earth, the<br /> attraction of gravitation,
      the form of the earths orbit,<br /> or the nebular hypothesis, with perfect
      impunity.<br /> He is not bound to be correct upon any philo-<br /> <br />
      VIII<br /> <br /> sophical subject. He is at liberty to deny and ridi-<br />
      cule the rule of three, conic sections, and even the<br /> multiplication
      table. God permits every human<br /> being to be mistaken upon every
      subject but one.<br /> No man can lose his soul by denying physical facts.<br />
      Jehovah does not take the slightest pride in his geology,<br /> <br /> or in
      his astronomy, or in mathematics, or in<br /> any school of philosophy&mdash;he
      is jealous only of his<br /> reputation as the author of the Bible. You may
      deny<br /> everything else in the universe except that book.<br /> This
      being so, Mr. Talmage takes the safe side, and<br /> insists that the Bible
      is inspired. He knows that at<br /> the day of judgment, not a scientific
      question will be<br /> asked. He knows that the H&aelig;ckels and Huxleys<br />
      will, on that terrible day, regret that they ever<br /> learned to read. He
      knows that there is no "saving<br /> grace" in any department of human
      knowledge; that<br /> mathematics and all the exact sciences and all the<br />
      philosophies will be worse than useless. He knows<br /> that inventors,
      discoverers, thinkers and investigators,<br /> have no claim upon the mercy
      of Jehovah; that the<br /> educated will envy the ignorant, and that the
      writers<br /> and thinkers will curse their books.<br /> <br /> He knows that
      man cannot be saved through<br /> what he knows&mdash;but only by means of
      what he<br /> <br /> IX<br /> <br /> believes. Theology is not a science. If
      it were,<br /> God would forgive his children for being mistaken<br /> about
      it. If it could be proved like geology, or<br /> astronomy, there would be
      no merit in believing it.<br /> From a belief in the Bible, Mr. Talmage is
      not to be<br /> driven by uninspired evidence. He knows that his<br /> logic
      is liable to lead him astray, and that his reason<br /> cannot be depended
      upon. He believes that scien-<br /> tific men are no authority in matters
      concerning<br /> which nothing can be known, and he does not wish<br /> to
      put his soul in peril, by examining by the light of<br /> reason, the
      evidences of the supernatural.<br /> <br /> He is perfectly consistent with
      his creed. What<br /> happens to us here is of no consequence compared<br />
      with eternal joy or pain. The ambitions, honors,<br /> glories and triumphs
      of this world, compared with<br /> eternal things, are less than naught.<br />
      <br /> Better a cross here and a crown there, than a feast<br /> here and a
      fire there.<br /> <br /> Lazarus was far more fortunate than Dives. The<br />
      purple and fine linen of this short life are as nothing<br /> compared with
      the robes of the redeemed.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage knows that philosophy is
      unsafe&mdash;<br /> that the sciences are sirens luring souls to eternal<br />
      wreck. He knows that the deluded searchers after<br /> <br /> X<br /> <br />
      facts are planting thorns in their own pillows&mdash;that<br /> the
      geologists are digging pits for themselves, and<br /> that the astronomers
      are robbing their souls of the<br /> heaven they explore. He knows that
      thought, capa-<br /> city, and intellectual courage are dangerous, and this<br />
      belief gives him a feeling of personal security.<br /> <br /> The Bible is
      adapted to the world as it is. Most<br /> people are ignorant, and but few
      have the capacity to<br /> comprehend philosophical and scientific
      subjects, and<br /> if salvation depended upon understanding even one<br />
      of the sciences, nearly everybody would be lost.<br /> Mr. Talmage sees
      that it was exceedingly merciful in<br /> God to base salvation on belief
      instead of on brain.<br /> Millions can believe, while only a few can
      understand.<br /> Even the effort to understand is a kind of treason<br />
      born of pride and ingratitude. This being so, it is far<br /> safer, far
      better, to be credulous than critical. You are<br /> offered an infinite
      reward for believing the Bible. If<br /> you examine it you may find it
      impossible for you to<br /> believe it. Consequently, examination is
      dangerous.<br /> Mr. Talmage knows that it is not necessary to under-<br />
      stand the Bible in order to believe it. You must be-<br /> lieve it first.
      Then, if on reading it you find anything<br /> that appears false, absurd,
      or impossible, you may<br /> be sure that it is only an appearance, and
      that the real<br /> <br /> XI<br /> <br /> fault is in yourself. It is certain
      that persons wholly<br /> incapable of reasoning are absolutely safe, and
      that<br /> to be born brainless is to be saved in advance.<br /> <br /> Mr.
      Talmage takes the ground,&mdash;and certainly from<br /> his point of view
      nothing can be more reasonable<br /> &mdash;that thought should be avoided,
      after one has<br /> "experienced religion" and has been the subject of<br />
      "regeneration." Every sinner should listen to ser-<br /> mons, read
      religious books, and keep thinking, until<br /> he becomes a Christian.
      Then he should stop. After<br /> that, thinking is not the road to heaven.
      The real<br /> point and the real difficulty is to stop thinking just at<br />
      the right time. Young Christians, who have no idea<br /> of what they are
      doing, often go on thinking after<br /> joining the church, and in this way
      heresy is born, and<br /> heresy is often the father of infidelity. If
      Christians<br /> would follow the advice and example of Mr. Talmage<br />
      all disagreements about doctrine would be avoided.<br /> In this way the
      church could secure absolute in-<br /> tellectual peace and all the
      disputes, heartburnings,<br /> jealousies and hatreds born of thought,
      discussion<br /> and reasoning, would be impossible.<br /> <br /> In the
      estimation of Mr. Talmage, the man who<br /> doubts and examines is not fit
      for the society of<br /> angels. There are no disputes, no discussions in<br />
      <br /> XII<br /> <br /> heaven. The angels do not think; they believe,<br />
      they enjoy. The highest form of religion is re-<br /> pression. We should
      conquer the passions and<br /> destroy desire. We should control the mind
      and<br /> stop thinking. In this way we "offer ourselves a<br /> "living
      sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God." When<br /> desire dies, when thought
      ceases, we shall be pure.<br /> &mdash;This is heaven.<br /> <br /> Robert G.

      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Have you read the sermon of<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage,
      in which he exposes your mis-<br /> representations?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      I have read such reports as appeared in<br /> some of the New York papers.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. What do you think of what he has<br /> to say?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Some time ago I gave it as my opinion<br /> of Mr.
      Talmage that, while he was a man of most<br /> excellent judgment, he was
      somewhat deficient in<br /> imagination. I find that he has the disease
      that seems<br /> <br /> 16<br /> <br /> to afflict most theologians, and that
      is, a kind of intel-<br /> lectual toadyism, that uses the names of
      supposed great<br /> men instead of arguments. It is perfectly astonishing<br />
      to the average preacher that any one should have the<br /> temerity to
      differ, on the subject of theology, with<br /> Andrew Jackson, Daniel
      Webster, and other gentlemen<br /> eminent for piety during their lives,
      but who,<br /> as a rule, expressed their theological opinions a few<br />
      minutes before dissolution. These ministers are per-<br /> fectly delighted
      to have some great politician, some<br /> judge, soldier, or president,
      certify to the truth of the<br /> Bible and to the moral character of Jesus
      Christ.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage insists that if a witness is false in one<br />
      particular, his entire testimony must be thrown away.<br /> Daniel Webster
      was in favor of the Fugitive Slave<br /> Law, and thought it the duty of
      the North to capture<br /> the poor slave-mother. He was willing to stand<br />
      between a human being and his freedom. He was<br /> willing to assist in
      compelling persons to work without<br /> any pay except such marks of the
      lash as they might<br /> receive. Yet this man is brought forward as a
      witness<br /> for the truth of the gospel. If he was false in his<br />
      testimony as to liberty, what is his affidavit worth as<br /> to the value
      of Christianity? Andrew Jackson was a<br /> brave man, a good general, a
      patriot second to none,<br /> <br /> 17<br /> <br /> an excellent judge of
      horses, and a brave duelist. I<br /> admit that in his old age he relied
      considerably upon<br /> the atonement. I think Jackson was really a very
      great<br /> man, and probably no President impressed himself<br /> more
      deeply upon the American people than the hero<br /> of New Orleans, but as
      a theologian he was, in my<br /> judgment, a most decided failure, and his
      opinion as<br /> to the authenticity of the Scriptures is of no earthly<br />
      value. It was a subject upon which he knew probably<br /> as little as Mr.
      Talmage does about modern infidelity.<br /> Thousands of people will quote
      Jackson in favor of<br /> religion, about which he knew nothing, and yet
      have<br /> no confidence in his political opinions, although he<br />
      devoted the best part of his life to politics.<br /> <br /> No man should
      quote the words of another, in place<br /> of an argument, unless he is
      willing to accept all the<br /> opinions of that man. Lord Bacon denied the
      Copernican<br /> <br /> system of astronomy, and, according to Mr.<br />
      Talmage, having made that mistake, his opinions upon<br /> other subjects
      are equally worthless. Mr. Wesley<br /> believed in ghosts, witches, and
      personal devils, yet<br /> upon many subjects I have no doubt his opinions
      were<br /> correct. The truth is, that nearly everybody is right<br /> about
      some things and wrong about most things; and<br /> if a man's testimony is
      not to be taken until he is<br /> <br /> 18<br /> <br /> right on every
      subject, witnesses will be extremely<br /> scarce.<br /> <br /> Personally, I
      care nothing about names. It makes<br /> no difference to me what the
      supposed great men of<br /> the past have said, except as what they have
      said<br /> contains an argument; and that argument is worth to<br /> me the
      force it naturally has upon my mind. Chris-<br /> tians forget that in the
      realm of reason there are no<br /> serfs and no monarchs. When you submit
      to an<br /> argument, you do not submit to the man who made it.<br />
      Christianity demands a certain obedience, a certain<br /> blind,
      unreasoning faith, and parades before the eyes<br /> of the ignorant, with
      great pomp and pride, the names<br /> of kings, soldiers, and statesmen who
      have admitted<br /> the truth of the Bible. Mr. Talmage introduces as a<br />
      witness the Rev. Theodore Parker. This same The-<br /> odore Parker
      denounced the Presbyterian creed as<br /> the most infamous of all creeds,
      and said that the worst<br /> heathen god, wearing a necklace of live
      snakes, was a<br /> representation of mercy when compared with the God<br />
      of John Calvin. Now, if this witness is false in any<br /> particular, of
      course he cannot be believed, according<br /> to Mr. Talmage, upon any
      subject, and yet Mr.<br /> Talmage introduces him upon the stand as a good<br />
      witness.<br /> <br /> 19<br /> <br /> Although I care but little for names,
      still I will sug-<br /> gest that, in all probability, Humboldt knew more
      upon<br /> this subject than all the pastors in the world. I cer-<br />
      tainly would have as much confidence in the opinion<br /> of Goethe as in
      that of William H. Seward; and as<br /> between Seward and Lincoln, I
      should take Lincoln;<br /> and when you come to Presidents, for my part, if
      I<br /> were compelled to pin my faith on the sleeve of any-<br /> body, I
      should take Jefferson's coat in preference to<br /> Jackson's. I believe
      that Haeckel is, to say the least,<br /> the equal of any theologian we
      have in this country,<br /> and the late John W. Draper certainly knew as
      much<br /> upon these great questions as the average parson. I<br /> believe
      that Darwin has investigated some of these<br /> things, that Tyndall and
      Huxley have turned their<br /> minds somewhat in the same direction, that
      Helmholtz<br /> has a few opinions, and that, in fact, thousands of able,<br />
      intelligent and honest men differ almost entirely with<br /> Webster and
      Jackson.<br /> <br /> So far as I am concerned, I think more of reasons<br />
      than of reputations, more of principles than of persons,<br /> more of
      nature than of names, more of facts, than of<br /> faiths.<br /> <br /> It is
      the same with books as with persons. Proba-<br /> bly there is not a book
      in the world entirely destitute<br /> <br /> 20<br /> <br /> of truth, and not
      one entirely exempt from error.<br /> The Bible is like other books. There
      are mistakes in<br /> it, side by side with truths,&mdash;passages
      inculcating<br /> murder, and others exalting mercy; laws devilish and<br />
      tyrannical, and others filled with wisdom and justice.<br /> It is foolish
      to say that if you accept a part, you must<br /> accept the whole. You must
      accept that which com-<br /> mends itself to your heart and brain. There
      never was<br /> a doctrine that a witness, or a book, should be thrown<br />
      entirely away, because false in one particular. If in<br /> any particular
      the book, or the man, tells the truth, to<br /> that extent the truth
      should be accepted.<br /> <br /> Truth is made no worse by the one who tells
      it,<br /> and a lie gets no real benefit from the reputation of its<br />
      author.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What do you think of the statement<br />
      that a general belief in your teachings would fill all<br /> the
      penitentiaries, and that in twenty years there<br /> would be a hell in
      this world worse than the one<br /> expected in the other?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      My creed is this:<br /> <br /> 1. Happiness is the only good.<br /> <br /> 2.
      The way to be happy, is to make others happy.<br /> <br /> 21<br /> <br />
      Other things being equal, that man is happiest who is<br /> nearest just&mdash;who
      is truthful, merciful and intelligent&mdash;<br /> in other words, the one
      who lives in accordance with<br /> the conditions of life.<br /> <br /> 3.
      The time to be happy is now, and the place to<br /> be happy, is here.<br />
      <br /> 4. Reason is the lamp of the mind&mdash;the only torch<br /> of
      progress; and instead of blowing that out and de-<br /> pending upon
      darkness and dogma, it is far better to<br /> increase that sacred light.<br />
      <br /> 5. Every man should be the intellectual proprietor<br /> of himself,
      honest with himself, and intellectually<br /> hospitable; and upon every
      brain reason should be<br /> enthroned as king.<br /> <br /> 6. Every man
      must bear the consequences, at<br /> least of his own actions. If he puts
      his hands in<br /> the fire, his hands must smart, and not the hands of<br />
      another. In other words: each man must eat the<br /> fruit of the tree he
      plants.<br /> <br /> I can not conceive that the teaching of these doc-<br />
      trines would fill penitentiaries, or crowd the gallows.<br /> The doctrine
      of forgiveness&mdash;the idea that somebody<br /> else can suffer in place
      of the guilty&mdash;the notion that<br /> just at the last the whole
      account can be settled&mdash;<br /> these ideas, doctrines, and notions are
      calculated to fill<br /> <br /> 22<br /> <br /> penitentiaries. Nothing breeds
      extravagance like the<br /> credit system.<br /> <br /> Most criminals of the
      present day are orthodox be-<br /> lievers, and the gallows seems to be the
      last round of<br /> the ladder reaching from earth to heaven. The Rev.<br />
      Dr. Sunderland, of this city, in his sermon on the assas-<br /> sination of
      Garfield, takes the ground that God per-<br /> mitted the murder for the
      purpose of opening the eyes<br /> of the people to the evil effects of
      infidelity. Accord-<br /> ing to this minister, God, in order to show his
      hatred<br /> of infidelity, "inspired," or allowed, one Christian to<br />
      assassinate another.<br /> <br /> Religion and morality do not necessarily
      go together.<br /> Mr. Talmage will insist to-day that morality is not<br />
      sufficient to save any man from eternal punishment.<br /> As a matter of
      fact, religion has often been the enemy<br /> of morality. The moralist has
      been denounced by the<br /> theologians. He sustains the same relation to
      Chris-<br /> tianity that the moderate drinker does to the total-<br />
      abstinence society. The total-abstinence people say<br /> that the example
      of the moderate drinker is far worse<br /> upon the young than that of the
      drunkard&mdash;that the<br /> drunkard is a warning, while the moderate
      drinker is<br /> a perpetual temptation. So Christians say of moral-<br />
      ists. According to them, the moralist sets a worse<br /> <br /> 23<br />
      <br /> example than the criminal. The moralist not only in-<br /> sists that
      a man can be a good citizen, a kind husband,<br /> an affectionate father,
      without religion, but demon-<br /> strates the truth of his doctrine by his
      own life;<br /> whereas the criminal admits that in and of himself he<br />
      is nothing, and can do nothing, but that he needs<br /> assistance from the
      church and its ministers.<br /> <br /> The worst criminals of the modern
      world have been<br /> Christians&mdash;I mean by that, believers in
      Christianity&mdash;<br /> and the most monstrous crimes of the modern world<br />
      have been committed by the most zealous believers.<br /> There is nothing
      in orthodox religion, apart from the<br /> morality it teaches, to prevent
      the commission oF crime.<br /> On the other hand, the perpetual proffer of
      forgiveness<br /> is a direct premium upon what Christians are pleased<br />
      to call the commission of sin.<br /> <br /> Christianity has produced no
      greater character than<br /> Epictetus, no greater sovereign than Marcus
      Aurelius.<br /> The wickedness of the past was a good deal like that<br />
      of the present. As a rule, kings have been wicked in<br /> direct
      proportion to their power&mdash;their power having<br /> been lessened,
      their crimes have decreased. As a<br /> matter of fact, paganism, of
      itself, did not produce any<br /> great men; neither has Christianity.
      Millions of in-<br /> fluences determine individual character, and the re-<br />
      <br /> 24<br /> <br /> ligion of the country in which a man happens to be<br />
      born may determine many of his opinions, without<br /> influencing, to any
      great extent, his real character.<br /> <br /> There have been brave,
      honest, and intelligent men<br /> in and out of every church.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Mr. Talmage says that you insist that,<br /> according to the Bible, the
      universe was made out of<br /> nothing, and he denounces your statement as
      a gross<br /> misrepresentation. What have you stated upon that<br />
      subject?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. What I said was substantially this: "We<br />
      "are told in the first chapter of Genesis, that in the<br /> "beginning God
      created the heaven and the earth.<br /> "If this means anything, it means
      that God pro-<br /> "duced&mdash;caused to exist, called into being&mdash;the<br />
      "heaven and the earth. It will not do to say that<br /> "God formed the
      heaven and the earth of previously<br /> "existing matter. Moses conveys,
      and intended to<br /> "convey, the idea that the matter of which the<br />
      "universe is composed was created."<br /> <br /> This has always been my
      position. I did not sup-<br /> pose that nothing was used as the raw
      material; but<br /> <br /> if the Mosaic account means anything, it means
      that<br /> whereas there was nothing, God caused something to<br /> <br /> 25<br />
      <br /> exist&mdash;created what we know as matter. I can not<br /> conceive
      of something being made, created, without<br /> anything to make anything
      with. I have no more<br /> confidence in fiat worlds than I have in fiat
      money.<br /> Mr. Talmage tells us that God did not make the uni-<br /> verse
      out of <i>nothing</i>, but out of "omnipotence."<br /> Exactly how God
      changed "omnipotence" into matter<br /> is not stated. If there was <i>nothing</i>
      in the universe,<br /> <i>omnipotence</i> could do you no good. The weakest
      man<br /> in the world can lift as much <i>nothing</i> as God.<br /> <br />
      Mr. Talmage seems to think that to create something<br /> from nothing is
      simply a question of strength&mdash;that it<br /> requires infinite muscle&mdash;that
      it is only a question of<br /> biceps. Of course, omnipotence is an
      attribute, not an<br /> entity, not a raw material; and the idea that
      something<br /> can be made out of omnipotence&mdash;using that as the<br />
      raw material&mdash;is infinitely absurd. It would have<br /> been equally
      logical to say that God made the universe<br /> out of his omniscience, or
      his omnipresence, or his<br /> unchangeableness, or out of his honesty, his
      holiness,<br /> or his incapacity to do evil. I confess my utter in-<br />
      ability to understand, or even to suspect, what the<br /> reverend
      gentleman means, when he says that God<br /> created the universe out of
      his "omnipotence."<br /> <br /> I admit that the Bible does not tell when
      God created<br /> <br /> 26<br /> <br /> the universe. It is simply said that
      he did this "in the<br /> beginning." We are left, however, to infer that
      "the<br /> beginning" was Monday morning, and that on the<br /> first Monday
      God created the matter in an exceedingly<br /> chaotic state; that on
      Tuesday he made a firmament<br /> to divide the waters from the waters;
      that on Wednes-<br /> day he gathered the waters together in seas and<br />
      allowed the dry land to appear. We are also told that<br /> on that day
      "the earth brought forth grass and herb<br /> "yielding seed after his
      kind, and the tree yielding<br /> "fruit, whose seed was in itself, after
      his kind." This<br /> was before the creation of the sun, but Mr. Talmage<br />
      takes the ground that there are many other sources of<br /> light; that
      "there may have been volcanoes in active<br /> operation on other planets."
      I have my doubts,<br /> however, about the light of volcanoes being
      sufficient<br /> to produce or sustain vegetable life, and think it a<br />
      little doubtful about trees growing only by "volcanic<br /> glare." Neither
      do I think one could depend upon<br /> "three thousand miles of liquid
      granite" for the pro-<br /> duction of grass and trees, nor upon "light
      that rocks<br /> might emit in the process of crystallization." I doubt<br />
      whether trees would succeed simply with the assistance<br /> of the "Aurora
      Borealis or the Aurora Australis."<br /> There are other sources of light,
      not mentioned by<br /> <br /> 27<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage&mdash;lightning-bugs,
      phosphorescent beetles,<br /> and fox-fire. I should think that it would be
      humili-<br /> ating, in this age, for an orthodox preacher to insist<br />
      that vegetation could exist upon this planet without the<br /> light of the
      sun&mdash;that trees could grow, blossom and<br /> bear fruit, having no
      light but the flames of volcanoes,<br /> or that emitted by liquid granite,
      or thrown off by the<br /> crystallization of rocks.<br /> <br /> There is
      another thing, also, that should not be for-<br /> gotten, and that is,
      that there is an even balance for-<br /> ever kept between the totals of
      animal and vegetable<br /> life&mdash;that certain forms of animal life go
      with certain<br /> forms of vegetable life. Mr. Haeckel has shown that<br />
      "in the first epoch, alg&aelig; and skull-less vertebrates<br /> were found
      together; in the second, ferns and fishes;<br /> in the third, pines and
      reptiles; in the fourth, foliaceous<br /> <br /> forests and mammals."
      Vegetable and animal<br /> life sustain a necessary relation; they exist
      together;<br /> they act and interact, and each depends upon the other.<br />
      The real point of difference between Mr. Talmage and<br /> myself is this:
      He says that God made the universe<br /> out of his "omnipotence," and I
      say that, although I<br /> know nothing whatever upon the subject, my
      opinion<br /> is, that the universe has existed from eternity&mdash;that it<br />
      continually changes in form, but that it never was<br /> <br /> 28<br />
      <br /> created or called into being by any power. I think<br /> that all
      that is, is all the God there is.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage
      charges you with having<br /> misrepresented the Bible story of the deluge.
      Has he<br /> correctly stated your position?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Mr.
      Talmage takes the ground that the<br /> flood was only partial, and was,
      after all, not much of a<br /> flood. The Bible tells us that God said he
      would<br /> "destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from<br />
      "under heaven, and that everything that is in the<br /> "earth shall die;"
      that God also said: "I will destroy<br /> "man, whom I have created, from
      the face of the<br /> "earth; both man and beast and the creeping thing<br />
      "and the fowls of the air, and every living substance<br /> "that I have
      made will I destroy from off the face of<br /> "the earth."<br /> <br /> I
      did not suppose that there was any miracle in the<br /> Bible larger than
      the credulity of Mr. Talmage. The<br /> flood story, however, seems to be a
      little more than<br /> he can bear. He is like the witness who stated that<br />
      he had read <i>Gullivers Travels</i>, the <i>Stories of Mun-<br /> chausen</i>,
      and the <i>Flying Wife</i>, including <i>Robinson<br /> Crusoe</i>, and
      believed them all; but that Wirt's <i>Life of<br /> Patrick Henry</i> was a
      litde more than he could stand.<br /> <br /> 29<br /> <br /> It is strange
      that a man who believes that God<br /> created the universe out of
      "omnipotence" should<br /> believe that he had not enough omnipotence left
      to<br /> drown a world the size of this. Mr. Talmage seeks<br /> to make the
      story of the flood reasonable. The<br /> moment it is reasonable, it ceases
      to be miraculous.<br /> Certainly God cannot afford to reward a man with<br />
      eternal joy for believing a reasonable story. Faith is<br /> only necessary
      when the story is unreasonable, and if<br /> the flood only gets small
      enough, I can believe it<br /> myself. I ask for evidence, and Mr. Talmage
      seeks<br /> to make the story so little that it can be believed<br />
      without evidence. He tells us that it was a kind of<br /> "local option"
      flood&mdash;a little wet for that part of the<br /> country.<br /> <br /> Why
      was it necessary to save the birds? They<br /> certainly could have gotten
      out of the way of a real<br /> small flood. Of the birds, Noah took
      fourteen of each<br /> species. He was commanded to take of the fowls of
      the<br /> air by sevens&mdash;seven of each sex&mdash;and, as there are<br />
      at least 12,500 species, Noah collected an aviary of<br /> about 175,000
      birds, provided the flood was general.<br /> If it was local, there are no
      means of determining the<br /> number. But why, if the flood was local,
      should he<br /> have taken any of the fowls of the air into his ark?<br />
      <br /> 30<br /> <br /> All they had to do was to fly away, or "roost high;"<br />
      and it would have been just as easy for God to have<br /> implanted in
      them, for the moment, the instinct of<br /> getting out of the way as the
      instinct of hunting the ark.<br /> It would have been quite a saving of
      room and pro-<br /> visions, and would have materially lessened the labor<br />
      and anxiety of Noah and his sons.<br /> <br /> Besides, if it had been a
      partial flood, and great<br /> enough to cover the highest mountains in
      that country,<br /> the highest mountain being about seventeen thousand<br />
      feet, the flood would have been covered with a sheet<br /> of ice several
      thousand feet in thickness. If a column<br /> of water could have been
      thrown seventeen thousand<br /> feet high and kept stationary, several
      thousand feet<br /> of the upper end would have frozen. If, however,<br />
      the deluge was general, then the atmosphere would<br /> have been forced
      out the same on all sides, and the<br /> climate remained substantially
      normal.<br /> <br /> Nothing can be more absurd than to attempt to<br />
      explain the flood by calling it partial.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage also says
      that the window ran clear<br /> round the ark, and that if I had only known
      as much<br /> Hebrew as a man could put on his little finger, I<br /> would
      have known that the window went clear round.<br /> To this I reply that, if
      his position is correct, then the<br /> <br /> 31<br /> <br /> original
      translators of King James' edition did not<br /> know as much Hebrew as
      they could have put on<br /> their little fingers; and yet I am obliged to
      believe<br /> their translation or be eternally damned. If the<br /> window
      went clear round, the inspired writer should<br /> have said so, and the
      learned translators should have<br /> given us the truth. No one pretends
      that there was<br /> more than one door, and yet the same language is<br />
      used about the door, except this&mdash;that the exact size<br /> of the
      window is given, and the only peculiarity men-<br /> tioned as to the door
      is that it shut from the outside.<br /> For any one to see that Mr. Talmage
      is wrong on the<br /> window question, it is only necessary to read the
      story<br /> of the deluge.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage also endeavors to
      decrease the depth<br /> of the flood. If the flood did not cover the
      highest<br /> hills, many people might have been saved. He also<br />
      insists that all the water did not come from the rains,<br /> but that "the
      fountains of the great deep were broken<br /> "up." What are "the fountains
      of the great deep"?<br /> How would their being "broken up" increase the<br />
      depth of the water? He seems to imagine that these<br /> "fountains" were
      in some way imprisoned&mdash;anxious<br /> to get to the surface, and that,
      at that time, an oppor-<br /> tunity was given for water to run up hill, or
      in some<br /> <br /> 32<br /> <br /> mysterious way to rise above its level.
      According to<br /> the account, the ark was at the mercy of the waves for<br />
      at least seven months. If this flood was only partial,<br /> it seems a
      little curious that the water did not seek its<br /> level in less than
      seven months. With anything like<br /> a fair chance, by that time most of
      it would have<br /> found its way to the sea again.<br /> <br /> There is in
      the literature of ignorance no more<br /> perfectly absurd and cruel story
      than that of the<br /> deluge.<br /> <br /> I am very sorry that Mr. Talmage
      should disagree<br /> with some of the great commentators. Dr. Scott<br />
      tells us that, in all probability, the angels assisted in<br /> getting the
      animals into the ark. Dr. Henry insists<br /> that the waters in the bowels
      of the earth, at God's<br /> command, sprung up and flooded the earth. Dr.<br />
      Clark tells us that it would have been much easier<br /> for God to have
      destroyed all the people and made<br /> some new ones, but that he did not
      want to waste<br /> anything. Dr. Henry also tells us that the lions, while<br />
      in the ark, ate straw like oxen. Nothing could be<br /> more amusing than
      to see a few lions eating good,<br /> dry straw. This commentator assures
      us that the<br /> waters rose so high that the loftiest mountains were<br />
      overflowed fifteen cubits, so that salvation was not<br /> <br /> 33<br />
      <br /> hoped for from any hills or mountains. He tells us<br /> that some of
      the people got on top of the ark, and<br /> hoped to shift for themselves,
      but that, in all proba-<br /> bility, they were washed off by the rain.
      When we<br /> consider that the rain must have fallen at the rate of<br />
      about eight hundred feet a day, I am inclined to think<br /> that they were
      washed off.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage has clearly misrepresented the Bible.<br />
      He is not prepared to believe the story as it is told.<br /> The seeds of
      infidelity seem to be germinating in his<br /> mind. His position no doubt
      will be a great relief to<br /> most of his hearers. After this, their
      credulity will<br /> not be strained. They can say that there was probably<br />
      quite a storm, some rain, to an extent that rendered it<br /> necessary for
      Noah and his family&mdash;his dogs, cats,<br /> and chickens&mdash;to get
      in a boat. This would not be<br /> unreasonable. The same thing happens
      almost every<br /> year on the shores of great rivers, and consequently<br />
      the story of the flood is an exceedingly reasonable<br /> one.<br /> <br />
      Mr. Talmage also endeavors to account for the<br /> miraculous collection
      of the animals in the ark by<br /> the universal instinct to get out of the
      rain. There<br /> are at least two objections to this: 1. The animals<br />
      went into the ark before the rain commenced; 2. I<br /> <br /> 34<br /> <br />
      have never noticed any great desire on the part of<br /> ducks, geese, and
      loons to get out of the water. Mr.<br /> Talmage must have been misled by a
      line from an old<br /> nursery book that says: "And the little fishes got<br />
      "under the bridge to keep out of the rain." He tells<br /> us that Noah
      described what he saw. He is the first<br /> theologian who claims that
      Genesis was written by<br /> Noah, or that Noah wrote any account of the
      flood.<br /> Most Christians insist that the account of the flood<br /> was
      written by Moses, and that he was inspired to<br /> write it. Of course, it
      will not do for me to say that<br /> Mr. Talmage has misrepresented the
      facts.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. You are also charged with misrepresen-<br />
      tation in your statement as to where the ark at last<br /> rested. It is
      claimed by Mr. Talmage that there is<br /> nothing in the Bible to show
      that the ark rested on<br /> the highest mountains.<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Of course I have no knowledge as to<br /> where the ark really came to
      anchor, but after it struck<br /> bottom, we are told that a dove was sent
      out, and<br /> that the dove found no place whereon to rest her<br /> foot.
      If the ark touched ground in the low country,<br /> surely the mountains
      were out of water, and an or-<br /> dinary mountain furnishes, as a rule,
      space enough<br /> <br /> 35<br /> <br /> for a dove's foot. We must infer
      that the ark rested<br /> on the only land then above water, or near enough<br />
      above water to strike the keel of Noah's boat. Mount<br /> Ararat is about
      seventeen thousand feet high; so I<br /> take it that the top of that
      mountain was where Noah<br /> ran aground&mdash;otherwise, the account
      means nothing.<br /> <br /> Here Mr. Talmage again shows his tendency to<br />
      belittle the miracles of the Bible. I am astonished<br /> that he should
      doubt the power of God to keep an<br /> ark on a mountain seventeen
      thousand feet high.<br /> He could have changed the climate for that
      occasion.<br /> He could have made all the rocks and glaciers pro-<br />
      duce wheat and corn in abundance. Certainly God,<br /> who could overwhelm
      a world with a flood, had the<br /> power to change every law and fact in
      nature.<br /> <br /> I am surprised that Mr. Talmage is not willing to<br />
      believe the story as it is told. What right has he to<br /> question the
      statements of an inspired writer? Why<br /> should he set up his judgment
      against the Websters<br /> and Jacksons? Is it not infinitely impudent in
      him<br /> to contrast his penny-dip with the sun of inspiration?<br /> What
      right has he to any opinion upon the subject?<br /> He must take the Bible
      as it reads. He should<br /> remember that the greater the miracle the
      greater<br /> should be his faith.<br /> <br /> 36<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      You do not seem to have any great<br /> opinion of the chemical,
      geological, and agricultural<br /> views expressed by Mr. Talmage?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. You must remember that Mr. Talmage<br /> has a certain
      thing to defend. He takes the Bible as<br /> actually true, and with the
      Bible as his standard, he<br /> compares and measures all sciences. He does
      not<br /> study geology to find whether the Mosaic account is<br /> true,
      but he reads the Mosaic account for the purpose<br /> of showing that
      geology can not be depended upon.<br /> His idea that "one day is as a
      thousand years with<br /> "God," and that therefore the "days" mentioned in
      the<br /> Mosaic account are not days of twenty-four hours, but<br /> long
      periods, is contradicted by the Bible itself. The<br /> great reason given
      for keeping the Sabbath day is, that<br /> "God rested on the seventh day
      and was refreshed."<br /> Now, it does not say that he rested on the
      "seventh<br /> "period," or the "seventh good&mdash;while," or the<br />
      "seventh long-time," but on the "seventh day." In<br /> imitation of this
      example we are also to rest&mdash;not on<br /> the seventh good-while, but
      on the seventh day.<br /> Nothing delights the average minister more than
      to<br /> find that a passage of Scripture is capable of several<br />
      interpretations. Nothing in the inspired book is so<br /> <br /> 37<br />
      <br /> dangerous as accuracy. If the holy writer uses<br /> general terms,
      an ingenious theologian can harmonize<br /> a seemingly preposterous
      statement with the most<br /> obdurate fact. An "inspired" book should
      contain<br /> neither statistics nor dates&mdash;as few names as possible,<br />
      and not one word about geology or astronomy. Mr.<br /> Talmage is doing the
      best he can to uphold the fables<br /> of the Jews. They are the foundation
      of his faith.<br /> He believes in the water of the past and the fire of
      the<br /> future&mdash;in the God of flood and flame&mdash;the eternal<br />
      torturer of his helpless children.<br /> <br /> It is exceedingly
      unfortunate that Mr. Talmage does<br /> not appreciate the importance of
      good manners, that<br /> he does not rightly estimate the convincing power
      of<br /> kindness and good nature. It is unfortunate that a<br /> Christian,
      believing in universal forgiveness, should<br /> exhibit so much of the
      spirit of detraction, that he<br /> should run so easily and naturally into
      epithets, and<br /> that he should mistake vituperation for logic. Thou-<br />
      sands of people, knowing but little of the mysteries of<br /> Christianity&mdash;never
      having studied theology,&mdash;may<br /> become prejudiced against the
      church, and doubt the<br /> divine origin of a religion whose defenders
      seem to<br /> rely, at least to a great degree, upon malignant per-<br />
      sonalities. Mr. Talmage should remember that in a<br /> <br /> 38<br /> <br />
      discussion of this kind, he is supposed to represent a<br /> being of
      infinite wisdom and goodness. Surely, the<br /> representative of the
      infinite can afford to be candid,<br /> can afford to be kind. When he
      contemplates the<br /> condition of a fellow-being destitute of religion, a<br />
      fellow-being now travelling the thorny path to eternal<br /> fire, he
      should be filled with pity instead of hate.<br /> Instead of deforming his
      mouth with scorn, his eyes<br /> should be filled with tears. He should
      take into<br /> consideration the vast difference between an infidel<br />
      and a minister of the gospel,&mdash;knowing, as he does,<br /> that a crown
      of glory has been prepared for the<br /> minister, and that flames are
      waiting for the soul<br /> of the unbeliever. He should bear with
      philosophic<br /> fortitude the apparent success of the skeptic, for a<br />
      few days in this brief life, since he knows that in a<br /> little while
      the question will be eternally settled in<br /> his favor, and that the
      humiliation of a day is as<br /> nothing compared with the victory of
      eternity. In<br /> this world, the skeptic appears to have the best<br /> of
      the argument; logic seems to be on the side<br /> of blasphemy; common
      sense apparently goes hand<br /> in hand with infidelity, and the few
      things we are<br /> absolutely certain of, seem inconsistent with the<br />
      Christian creeds.<br /> <br /> 39<br /> <br /> This, however, as Mr. Talmage
      well knows, is but<br /> apparent. God has arranged the world in this way<br />
      for the purpose of testing the Christian's faith.<br /> Beyond all these
      facts, beyond logic, beyond reason,<br /> Mr. Talmage, by the light of
      faith, clearly sees the<br /> eternal truth. This clearness of vision
      should give<br /> him the serenity of candor and the kindness born of<br />
      absolute knowledge. He, being a child of the light,<br /> should not expect
      the perfect from the children of<br /> darkness. He should not judge
      Humboldt and<br /> Wesley by the same standard. He should remember<br />
      that Wesley was especially set apart and illuminated<br /> by divine
      wisdom, while Humboldt was left to grope<br /> in the shadows of nature. He
      should also remember<br /> that ministers are not like other people. They
      have<br /> been "called." They have been "chosen" by infinite<br /> wisdom.
      They have been "set apart," and they<br /> have bread to eat that we know
      not of. While<br /> other people are forced to pursue the difficult paths<br />
      of investigation, they fly with the wings of faith.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage
      is perfectly aware of the advantages<br /> he enjoys, and yet he deems it
      dangerous to be fair.<br /> This, in my judgment, is his mistake. If he
      cannot<br /> easily point out the absurdities and contradictions in<br />
      infidel lectures, surely God would never have selected<br /> <br /> 40<br />
      <br /> him for that task. We cannot believe that imperfect<br /> instruments
      would be chosen by infinite wisdom.<br /> Certain lambs have been entrusted
      to the care of Mr.<br /> Talmage, the shepherd. Certainly God would not<br />
      select a shepherd unable to cope with an average<br /> wolf. Such a
      shepherd is only the appearance of<br /> protection. When the wolf is not
      there, he is a<br /> useless expense, and when the wolf comes, he goes.<br />
      I cannot believe that God would select a shepherd<br /> of that kind.
      Neither can the shepherd justify his<br /> selection by abusing the wolf
      when out of sight.<br /> The fear ought to be on the other side. A divinely<br />
      appointed shepherd ought to be able to convince his<br /> sheep that a wolf
      is a dangerous animal, and ought<br /> to be able to give his reasons. It
      may be that the<br /> shepherd has a certain interest in exaggerating the<br />
      cruelty and ferocity of the wolf, and even the number<br /> of the wolves.
      Should it turn out that the wolves<br /> exist only in the imagination of
      the shepherd, the<br /> sheep might refuse to pay the salary of their pro-<br />
      tector. It will, however, be hard to calculate the<br /> extent to which
      the sheep will lose confidence in a<br /> shepherd who has not even the
      courage to state the<br /> facts about the wolf. But what must be the
      result<br /> when the sheep find that the supposed wolf is, in<br /> <br />
      41<br /> <br /> fact, their friend, and that he is endeavoring to rescue<br />
      them from the exactions of the pretended shepherd,<br /> who creates, by
      falsehood, the fear on which he<br /> lives?<br /> <br /> <br /> <a

      <br /> <br /> <i>Por. Why, man, what's the matter? Don't tear<br /> your
      hair.<br /> <br /> Sir Hugh. I have been beaten in a discussion,<br />
      overwhelmed and humiliated.<br /> <br /> Por. Why didn't you call your
      adversary a fool?<br /> <br /> Sir Hugh. My God! I forgot it!</i><br /> <br />
      <i>Question</i>. I want to ask you a few questions<br /> about the second
      sermon of Mr. Talmage;<br /> have you read it, and what do you think of it?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The text taken by the reverend gentle-<br /> man is an
      insult, and was probably intended as such:<br /> "The fool hath said in his
      heart, there is no God."<br /> Mr. Talmage seeks to apply this text to any
      one<br /> who denies that the Jehovah of the Jews was and is<br /> the
      infinite and eternal Creator of all. He is per-<br /> fectly satisfied that
      any man who differs with him on<br /> this question is a "fool," and he has
      the Christian<br /> forbearance and kindness to say so. I presume he<br />
      <br /> 46<br /> <br /> is honest in this opinion, and no doubt regards Bruno,<br />
      Spinoza and Humboldt as driveling imbeciles. He<br /> entertains the same
      opinion of some of the greatest,<br /> wisest and best of Greece and Rome.<br />
      <br /> No man is fitted to reason upon this question who<br /> has not the
      intelligence to see the difficulties in all<br /> theories. No man has yet
      evolved a theory that<br /> satisfactorily accounts for all that is. No
      matter<br /> what his opinion may be, he is beset by a thousand<br />
      difficulties, and innumerable things insist upon an<br /> explanation. The
      best that any man can do is to<br /> take that theory which to his mind
      presents the<br /> fewest difficulties. Mr. Talmage has been educated<br />
      in a certain way&mdash;has a brain of a certain quantity,<br /> quality and
      form&mdash;and accepts, in spite it may be,<br /> of himself, a certain
      theory. Others, formed differ-<br /> ently, having lived under different
      circumstances,<br /> cannot accept the Talmagian view, and thereupon he<br />
      denounces them as fools. In this he follows the<br /> example of David the
      murderer; of David, who<br /> advised one of his children to assassinate
      another;<br /> of David, whose last words were those of hate and<br />
      crime. Mr. Talmage insists that it takes no especial<br /> brain to reason
      out a "design" in Nature, and in a<br /> moment afterward says that "when
      the world slew<br /> <br /> 47<br /> <br /> "Jesus, it showed what it would do
      with the eternal<br /> "God, if once it could get its hands on Him." Why<br />
      should a God of infinite wisdom create people who<br /> would gladly murder
      their Creator? Was there any<br /> particular "design" in that? Does the
      existence<br /> of such people conclusively prove the existence of a<br />
      good Designer? It seems to me&mdash;and I take it that<br /> my thought is
      natural, as I have only been born<br /> once&mdash;that an infinitely wise
      and good God would<br /> naturally create good people, and if he has not,
      cer-<br /> tainly the fault is his. The God of Mr. Talmage<br /> knew, when
      he created Guiteau, that he would<br /> assassinate Garfield. Why did he
      create him? Did<br /> he want Garfield assassinated? Will somebody be<br />
      kind enough to show the "design" in this trans-<br /> action? Is it
      possible to see "design" in earth-<br /> quakes, in volcanoes, in
      pestilence, in famine, in<br /> ruthless and relentless war? Can we find
      "design" in<br /> the fact that every animal lives upon some other&mdash;<br />
      that every drop of every sea is a battlefield where<br /> the strong devour
      the weak? Over the precipice<br /> of cruelty rolls a perpetual Niagara of
      blood. Is<br /> there "design" in this? Why should a good God<br /> people a
      world with men capable of burning their<br /> fellow-men&mdash;and capable
      of burning the greatest and<br /> <br /> 48<br /> <br /> best? Why does a good
      God permit these things?<br /> It is said of Christ that he was infinitely
      kind and<br /> generous, infinitely merciful, because when on earth<br /> he
      cured the sick, the lame and blind. Has he not<br /> as much power now as
      he had then? If he was and<br /> is the God of all worlds, why does he not
      now give<br /> back to the widow her son? Why does he with-<br /> hold light
      from the eyes of the blind? And why<br /> does one who had the power
      miraculously to feed<br /> thousands, allow millions to die for want of
      food?<br /> Did Christ only have pity when he was part human?<br /> Are we
      indebted for his kindness to the flesh that<br /> clothed his spirit? Where
      is he now? Where has he<br /> been through all the centuries of slavery and
      crime?<br /> If this universe was "designed," then all that<br /> happens
      was "designed." If a man constructs an<br /> engine, the boiler of which
      explodes, we say either<br /> that he did not know the strength of his
      materials, or<br /> that he was reckless of human life. If an infinite
      being<br /> should construct a weak or imperfect machine, he must<br /> be
      held accountable for all that happens. He cannot<br /> be permitted to say
      that he did not know the strength<br /> of the materials. He is directly
      and absolutely re-<br /> sponsible. So, if this world was designed by a
      being<br /> of infinite power and wisdom, he is responsible for<br /> <br />
      49<br /> <br /> the result of that design. My position is this: I do<br />
      not know. But there are so many objections to the<br /> personal-God
      theory, that it is impossible for me to<br /> accept it. I prefer to say
      that the universe is all the<br /> God there is. I prefer to make no being
      responsible.<br /> I prefer to say: If the naked are clothed, man<br /> must
      clothe them; if the hungry are fed, man must<br /> feed them. I prefer to
      rely upon human endeavor,<br /> upon human intelligence, upon the heart and
      brain<br /> of man. There is no evidence that God has ever<br /> interfered
      in the affairs of man. The hand of earth<br /> is stretched uselessly
      toward heaven. From the<br /> clouds there comes no help. In vain the
      shipwrecked<br /> cry to God. In vain the imprisoned ask for liberty<br />
      and light&mdash;the world moves on, and the heavens are<br /> deaf and dumb
      and blind. The frost freezes, the fire<br /> burns, slander smites, the
      wrong triumphs, the good<br /> suffer, and prayer dies upon the lips of
      faith.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage charges you with being<br />
      "the champion blasphemer of America"&mdash;what do<br /> you understand
      blasphemy to be?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Blasphemy is an epithet
      bestowed by su-<br /> perstition upon common sense. Whoever investi-<br />
      gates a religion as he would any department of<br /> <br /> 50<br /> <br />
      science, is called a blasphemer. Whoever contradicts<br /> a priest,
      whoever has the impudence to use his own<br /> reason, whoever is brave
      enough to express his<br /> honest thought, is a blasphemer in the eyes of
      the<br /> religionist. When a missionary speaks slightingly of<br /> the
      wooden god of a savage, the savage regards him<br /> as a blasphemer. To
      laugh at the pretensions of<br /> Mohammed in Constantinople is blasphemy.
      To say<br /> in St. Petersburg that Mohammed was a prophet of<br /> God is
      also blasphemy. There was a time when to<br /> acknowledge the divinity of
      Christ in Jerusalem was<br /> blasphemy. To deny his divinity is now
      blasphemy<br /> in New York. Blasphemy is to a considerable extent<br /> a
      geographical question. It depends not only on what<br /> you say, but where
      you are when you say it. Blas-<br /> phemy is what the old calls the new,&mdash;what
      last<br /> year's leaf says to this year's bud. The founder of<br /> every
      religion was a blasphemer. The Jews so re-<br /> garded Christ, and the
      Athenians had the same<br /> opinion of Socrates. Catholics have always
      looked<br /> upon Protestants as blasphemers, and Protestants have<br />
      always held the same generous opinion of Catholics.<br /> To deny that Mary
      is the Mother of God is blas-<br /> phemy. To say that she is the Mother of
      God is<br /> blasphemy. Some savages think that a dried snake-<br /> <br />
      51<br /> <br /> skin stuffed with leaves is sacred, and he who thinks<br />
      otherwise is a blasphemer. It was once blasphemy<br /> to laugh at Diana,
      of the Ephesians. Many people<br /> think that it is blasphemous to tell
      your real opinion<br /> of the Jewish Jehovah. Others imagine that words<br />
      can be printed upon paper, and the paper bound into<br /> a book covered
      with sheepskin, and that the book is<br /> sacred, and that to question its
      sacredness is blas-<br /> phemy. Blasphemy is also a crime against God, but<br />
      nothing can be more absurd than a crime against<br /> God. If God is
      infinite, you cannot injure him. You<br /> cannot commit a crime against
      any being that you<br /> cannot injure. Of course, the infinite cannot be
      in-<br /> jured. Man is a conditioned being. By changing<br /> his
      conditions, his surroundings, you can injure him;<br /> but if God is
      infinite, he is conditionless. If he is<br /> conditionless, he cannot by
      any possibility be injured.<br /> You can neither increase, nor decrease,
      the well-being<br /> of the infinite. Consequently, a crime against God<br />
      is a demonstrated impossibility. The cry of blasphemy<br /> means only that
      the argument of the blasphemer can-<br /> not be answered. The
      sleight-of-hand performer,<br /> when some one tries to raise the curtain
      behind which<br /> he operates, cries "blasphemer!" The priest, find-<br />
      ing that he has been attacked by common sense,&mdash;<br /> <br /> 52<br />
      <br /> by a fact,&mdash;resorts to the same cry. Blasphemy is the<br />
      black flag of theology, and it means: No argument<br /> and no quarter! It
      is an appeal to prejudice, to<br /> passions, to ignorance. It is the last
      resort of a<br /> defeated priest. Blasphemy marks the point where<br />
      argument stops and slander begins. In old times, it<br /> was the signal
      for throwing stones, for gathering<br /> fagots and for tearing flesh; now
      it means falsehood<br /> and calumny.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Then you
      think that there is no such<br /> thing as the crime of blasphemy, and that
      no such<br /> offence can be committed?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Any one
      who knowingly speaks in favor<br /> of injustice is a blasphemer. Whoever
      wishes to<br /> destroy liberty of thought,&mdash;the honest expression of<br />
      ideas,&mdash;is a blasphemer. Whoever is willing to malign<br /> his
      neighbor, simply because he differs with him upon<br /> a subject about
      which neither of them knows anything<br /> for certain, is a blasphemer. If
      a crime can be com-<br /> mitted against God, he commits it who imputes to<br />
      God the commission of crime. The man who says<br /> that God ordered the
      assassination of women and<br /> babes, that he gave maidens to satisfy the
      lust of<br /> soldiers, that he enslaved his own children,&mdash;that man<br />
      <br /> 53<br /> <br /> is a blasphemer. In my judgment, it would be far<br />
      better to deny the existence of God entirely. It<br /> seems to me that
      every man ought to give his honest<br /> opinion. No man should suppose
      that any infinite<br /> God requires him to tell as truth that which he
      knows<br /> nothing about.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage, in order to make a point
      against<br /> infidelity, states from his pulpit that I am in favor of<br />
      poisoning the minds of children by the circulation of<br /> immoral books.
      The statement is entirely false. He<br /> ought to have known that I
      withdrew from the Liberal<br /> League upon the very question whether the
      law should<br /> be repealed or modified. I favored a modification<br /> of
      that law, so that books and papers could not be<br /> thrown from the mails
      simply because they were<br /> "infidel."<br /> <br /> I was and am in favor
      of the destruction of<br /> every immoral book in the world. I was and am<br />
      in favor, not only of the law against the circulation<br /> of such filth,
      but want it executed to the letter in every<br /> State of this Union. Long
      before he made that state-<br /> ment, I had introduced a resolution to
      that effect, and<br /> supported the resolution in a speech. Notwithstand-<br />
      ing these facts, hundreds of clergymen have made<br /> haste to tell the
      exact opposite of the truth. This<br /> <br /> 54<br /> <br /> they have done
      in the name of Christianity, under the<br /> pretence of pleasing their
      God. In my judgment, it<br /> is far better to tell your honest opinions,
      even upon<br /> the subject of theology, than to knowingly tell a false-<br />
      hood about a fellow-man. Mr. Talmage may have<br /> been ignorant of the
      truth. He may have been misled<br /> by other ministers, and for his
      benefit I make this ex-<br /> planation. I wanted the laws modified so that
      bigotry<br /> could not interfere with the literature of intelligence;<br />
      but I did not want, in any way, to shield the writers or<br /> publishers
      of immoral books. Upon this subject I<br /> used, at the last meeting of
      the Liberal League that<br /> I attended, the following language:<br />
      <br /> "But there is a distinction wide as the Mississippi,<br /> "yes,
      wider than the Atlantic, wider than all oceans,<br /> "between the
      literature of immorality and the litera-<br /> "ture of free thought. One
      is a crawling, slimy lizard,<br /> "and the other an angel with wings of
      light. Let us<br /> "draw this distinction. Let us understand ourselves.<br />
      "Do not make the wholesale statement that all these<br /> "laws ought to be
      repealed. They ought not to be<br /> "repealed. Some of them are good, and
      the law<br /> "against sending instruments of vice through the<br /> "mails
      is good. The law against sending obscene<br /> "pictures and books is good.
      The law against send-<br /> <br /> 55<br /> <br /> "ing bogus diplomas through
      the mails, to allow a<br /> "lot of ignorant hyenas to prey upon the sick
      people<br /> "of the world, is a good law. The law against rascals<br />
      "who are getting up bogus lotteries, and sending their<br /> "circulars in
      the mails is a good law. You know, as<br /> "well as I, that there are
      certain books not fit to go<br /> "through the mails. You know that. You
      know there<br /> "are certain pictures not fit to be transmitted, not fit<br />
      "to be delivered to any human being. When these<br /> "books and pictures
      come into the control of the<br /> "United States, I say, burn them up! And
      when any<br /> "man has been indicted who has been trying to make<br />
      "money by pandering to the lowest passions in the<br /> "human breast, then
      I say, prosecute him! let the<br /> "law take its course."<br /> <br /> I can
      hardly convince myself that when Mr.<br /> Talmage made the charge, he was
      acquainted with<br /> the facts. It seems incredible that any man, pre-<br />
      tending to be governed by the law of common<br /> honesty, could make a
      charge like this knowing<br /> it to be untrue. Under no circumstances,
      would<br /> I charge Mr. Talmage with being an infamous<br /> man, unless
      the evidence was complete and over-<br /> whelming. Even then, I should
      hesitate long before<br /> making the charge. The side I take on
      theological<br /> <br /> 56<br /> <br /> questions does not render a resort to
      slander or<br /> calumny a necessity. If Mr. Talmage is an honor-<br /> able
      man, he will take back the statement he has<br /> made. Even if there is a
      God, I hardly think that<br /> he will reward one of his children for
      maligning<br /> another; and to one who has told falsehoods about<br />
      "infidels," that having been his only virtue, I doubt<br /> whether he will
      say: "Well done good and faithful<br /> "servant."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      What have you to say to the charge<br /> that you are endeavoring to
      "assassinate God,"<br /> and that you are "far worse than the man who at-<br />
      "tempts to kill his father, or his mother, or his sister,<br /> "or his
      brother"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Well, I think that is about as reason-<br />
      able as anything he says. No one wishes, so far as I<br /> know, to
      assassinate God. The idea of assassinating<br /> an infinite being is of
      course infinitely absurd. One<br /> would think Mr. Talmage had lost his
      reason! And<br /> yet this man stands at the head of the Presbyterian<br />
      clergy. It is for this reason that I answer him. He<br /> is the only
      Presbyterian minister in the United<br /> States, so far as I know, able to
      draw an audience.<br /> He is, without doubt, the leader of that
      denomination.<br /> <br /> 57<br /> <br /> He is orthodox and conservative. He
      believes im-<br /> plicitly in the "Five Points" of Calvin, and says<br />
      nothing simply for the purpose of attracting attention.<br /> He believes
      that God damns a man for his own glory;<br /> that he sends babes to hell
      to establish his mercy,<br /> and that he filled the world with disease and
      crime<br /> simply to demonstrate his wisdom. He believes that<br />
      billions of years before the earth was, God had made<br /> up his mind as
      to the exact number that he would<br /> eternally damn, and had counted his
      saints. This<br /> doctrine he calls "glad tidings of great joy." He<br />
      really believes that every man who is true to himself<br /> is waging war
      against God; that every infidel is a<br /> rebel; that every Freethinker is
      a traitor, and that<br /> only those are good subjects who have joined the<br />
      Presbyterian Church, know the Shorter Catechism by<br /> heart, and
      subscribe liberally toward lifting the mort-<br /> gage on the Brooklyn
      Tabernacle. All the rest are<br /> endeavoring to assassinate God, plotting
      the murder<br /> of the Holy Ghost, and applauding the Jews for the<br />
      crucifixion of Christ. If Mr. Talmage is correct in<br /> his views as to
      the power and wisdom of God, I<br /> imagine that his enemies at last will
      be overthrown,<br /> that the assassins and murderers will not succeed, and<br />
      that the Infinite, with Mr. Talmage s assistance, will<br /> <br /> 58<br />
      <br /> finally triumph. If there is an infinite God, certainly<br /> he
      ought to have made man grand enough to have<br /> and express an opinion of
      his own. Is it possible<br /> that God can be gratified with the applause
      of moral<br /> cowards? Does he seek to enhance his glory by<br /> receiving
      the adulation of cringing slaves? Is God<br /> satisfied with the adoration
      of the frightened?<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. You notice that Mr. Talmage
      finds<br /> nearly all the inventions of modern times mentioned<br /> in the
      Bible?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>: Yes; Mr. Talmage has made an ex-<br />
      ceedingly important discovery. I admit that I am<br /> somewhat amazed at
      the wisdom of the ancients.<br /> This discovery has been made just in the
      nick of<br /> time. Millions of people were losing their respect<br /> for
      the Old Testament. They were beginning to<br /> think that there was some
      discrepancy between the<br /> prophecies of Ezekiel and Daniel and the
      latest devel-<br /> opments in physical science. Thousands of preachers<br />
      were telling their flocks that the Bible is not a<br /> scientific book;
      that Joshua was not an inspired as-<br /> tronomer, that God never
      enlightened Moses about<br /> geology, and that Ezekiel did not understand
      the<br /> entire art of cookery. These admissions caused<br /> <br /> 59<br />
      <br /> some young people to suspect that the Bible, after all,<br /> was not
      inspired; that the prophets of antiquity did<br /> not know as much as the
      discoverers of to-day. The<br /> Bible was falling into disrepute. Mr.
      Talmage has<br /> rushed to the rescue. He shows, and shows conclu-<br />
      sively as anything can be shown from the Bible, that<br /> Job understood
      all the laws of light thousands of<br /> years before Newton lived; that he
      anticipated the<br /> discoveries of Descartes, Huxley and Tyndall; that<br />
      he was familiar with the telegraph and telephone;<br /> that Morse, Bell
      and Edison simply put his discov-<br /> eries in successful operation; that
      Nahum was, in<br /> fact, a master-mechanic; that he understood perfectly<br />
      the modern railway and described it so accurately<br /> that Trevethick,
      Foster and Stephenson had no diffi-<br /> culty in constructing a
      locomotive. He also has<br /> discovered that Job was well acquainted with
      the<br /> trade winds, and understood the mysterious currents,<br /> tides
      and pulses of the sea; that Lieutenant Maury<br /> was a plagiarist; that
      Humboldt was simply a biblical<br /> student. He finds that Isaiah and
      Solomon were<br /> far in advance of Galileo, Morse, Meyer and Watt.<br />
      This is a discovery wholly unexpected to me. If<br /> Mr. Talmage is right,
      I am satisfied the Bible is an<br /> inspired book. If it shall turn out
      that Joshua was<br /> <br /> 60<br /> <br /> superior to Laplace, that Moses
      knew more about<br /> geology than Humboldt, that Job as a scientist was<br />
      the superior of Kepler, that Isaiah knew more than<br /> Copernicus, and
      that even the minor prophets ex-<br /> celled the inventors and discoverers
      of our time&mdash;<br /> then I will admit that infidelity must become
      speech-<br /> less forever. Until I read this sermon, I had never<br /> even
      suspected that the inventions of modern times<br /> were known to the
      ancient Jews. I never supposed<br /> that Nahum knew the least thing about
      railroads, or<br /> that Job would have known a telegraph if he had seen<br />
      it. I never supposed that Joshua comprehended the<br /> three laws of
      Kepler. Of course I have not read<br /> the Old Testament with as much care
      as some other<br /> people have, and when I did read it, I was not looking<br />
      for inventions and discoveries. I had been told so<br /> often that the
      Bible was no authority upon scientific<br /> questions, that I was lulled
      into a state of lethargy.<br /> What is amazing to me is, that so many men
      did<br /> read it without getting the slightest hint of the<br /> smallest
      invention. To think that the Jews read that<br /> book for hundreds and
      hundreds of years, and yet<br /> went to their graves without the slightest
      notion of<br /> astronomy, or geology, of railroads, telegraphs, or<br />
      steamboats! And then to think that the early fathers<br /> <br /> 61<br />
      <br /> made it the study of their lives and died without in-<br /> venting
      anything! I am astonished that Mr. Talmage<br /> himself does not figure in
      the records of the Patent<br /> Office. I cannot account for this, except
      upon the<br /> supposition that he is too honest to infringe on the<br />
      patents of the patriarchs. After this, I shall read<br /> the Old Testament
      with more care.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you see that Mr. Talmage
      endeav-<br /> ors to convict you of great ignorance in not knowing<br />
      that the word translated "rib" should have been<br /> translated "side,"
      and that Eve, after all, was not<br /> made out of a rib, but out of Adam's
      side?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I may have been misled by taking the<br />
      Bible as it is translated. The Bible account is simply<br /> this: "And the
      Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall<br /> "upon Adam, and he slept. And he
      took one of<br /> "his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof;<br />
      "and the rib which the Lord God had taken from<br /> "man made he a woman,
      and brought her unto the<br /> "man. And Adam said: This is now bone of my<br />
      "bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called<br /> "woman, because
      she was taken out of man." If<br /> Mr. Talmage is right, then the account
      should be as<br /> follows: "And the Lord God caused a deep sleep<br />
      <br /> 62<br /> <br /> "to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one<br />
      "of his sides, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;<br /> "and the side
      which the Lord God had taken from<br /> "man made he a woman, and brought
      her unto the<br /> "man. And Adam said: This is now side of my<br /> "side,
      and flesh of my flesh." I do not see that the<br /> story is made any
      better by using the word "side"<br /> instead of "rib." It would be just as
      hard for God<br /> to make a woman out of a man's side as out of a<br />
      rib. Mr. Talmage ought not to question the power<br /> of God to make a
      woman out of a bone, and he must<br /> recollect that the less the material
      the greater the<br /> miracle.<br /> <br /> There are two accounts of the
      creation of man,<br /> in Genesis, the first being in the twenty-first
      verse<br /> of the first chapter and the second being in the<br />
      twenty-first and twenty-second verses of the sec-<br /> ond chapter.<br />
      <br /> According to the second account, "God formed<br /> "man of the dust
      of the ground, and breathed into<br /> "his nostrils the breath of life."
      And after this,<br /> "God planted a garden eastward in Eden and put<br />
      "the man" in this garden. After this, "He made<br /> "every tree to grow
      that was good for food and<br /> "pleasant to the sight," and, in addition,
      "the tree<br /> <br /> 63<br /> <br /> "of life in the midst of the garden,"
      beside "the tree<br /> "of the knowledge of good and evil." And he "put<br />
      "the man in the garden to dress it and keep it,"<br /> telling him that he
      might eat of everything he saw<br /> except of "the tree of the knowledge
      of good and<br /> "evil."<br /> <br /> After this, God having noticed that it
      "was not<br /> "good for man to be alone, formed out of the ground<br />
      "every beast of the field, every fowl of the air, and<br /> "brought them
      to Adam to see what he would call<br /> "them, and Adam gave names to all
      cattle, and to<br /> "the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field.<br />
      "But for Adam there was not found an helpmeet for<br /> "him."<br /> <br />
      We are not told how Adam learned the language,<br /> or how he understood
      what God said. I can hardly<br /> believe that any man can be created with
      the know-<br /> ledge of a language. Education cannot be ready<br /> made
      and stuffed into a brain. Each person must<br /> learn a language for
      himself. Yet in this account we<br /> find a language ready made for man's
      use. And not<br /> only man was enabled to speak, but a serpent also<br />
      has the power of speech, and the woman holds a<br /> conversation with this
      animal and with her husband;<br /> and yet no account is given of how any
      language was<br /> <br /> 64<br /> <br /> learned. God is described as walking
      in the garden<br /> in the cool of the day, speaking like a man&mdash;holding<br />
      conversations with the man and woman, and occa-<br /> sionally addressing
      the serpent.<br /> <br /> In the nursery rhymes of the world there is<br />
      nothing more childish than this "inspired" account<br /> of the creation of
      man and woman.<br /> <br /> The early fathers of the church held that woman<br />
      was inferior to man, because man was not made for<br /> woman, but woman
      for man; because Adam was<br /> made first and Eve afterward. They had not
      the<br /> gallantry of Robert Burns, who accounted for the<br /> beauty of
      woman from the fact that God practiced<br /> on man first, and then gave
      woman the benefit of<br /> his experience. Think, in this age of the world,<br />
      of a well-educated, intelligent gentleman telling his<br /> little child
      that about six thousand years ago a<br /> mysterious being called God made
      the world out of<br /> his "omnipotence;" then made a man out of some<br />
      dust which he is supposed to have moulded into<br /> form; that he put this
      man in a garden for the pur-<br /> pose of keeping the trees trimmed; that
      after a little<br /> while he noticed that the man seemed lonesome, not<br />
      particularly happy, almost homesick; that then it oc-<br /> curred to this
      God, that it would be a good thing for<br /> <br /> 65<br /> <br /> the man to
      have some company, somebody to help<br /> him trim the trees, to talk to
      him and cheer him up<br /> on rainy days; that, thereupon, this God caused<br />
      a deep sleep to fall on the man, took a knife, or a<br /> long, sharp piece
      of "omnipotence," and took out one<br /> of the man's sides, or a rib, and
      of that made a<br /> woman; that then this man and woman got along<br />
      real well till a snake got into the garden and induced<br /> the woman to
      eat of the tree of the knowledge of<br /> good and evil; that the woman got
      the man to take<br /> a bite; that afterwards both of them were detected by<br />
      God, who was walking around in the cool of the<br /> evening, and thereupon
      they were turned out of the<br /> garden, lest they should put forth their
      hands and eat<br /> of the tree of life, and live forever.<br /> <br /> This
      foolish story has been regarded as the sacred,<br /> inspired truth; as an
      account substantially written by<br /> God himself; and thousands and
      millions of people<br /> have supposed it necessary to believe this
      childish<br /> falsehood, in order to save their souls. Nothing<br /> more
      laughable can be found in the fairy tales and<br /> folk-lore of savages.
      Yet this is defended by the<br /> leading Presbyterian divine, and those
      who fail to<br /> believe in the truth of this story are called "brazen<br />
      "faced fools," "deicides," and "blasphemers."<br /> <br /> 66<br /> <br /> By
      this story woman in all Christian countries was<br /> degraded. She was
      considered too impure to preach<br /> the gospel, too impure to distribute
      the sacramental<br /> bread, too impure to hand about the sacred wine,<br />
      too impure to step within the "holy of holies," in the<br /> Catholic
      Churches, too impure to be touched by a<br /> priest. Unmarried men were
      considered purer than<br /> husbands and fathers. Nuns were regarded as su-<br />
      perior to mothers, a monastery holier than a home, a<br /> nunnery nearer
      sacred than the cradle. And through<br /> all these years it has been
      thought better to love<br /> God than to love man, better to love God than
      to<br /> love your wife and children, better to worship an<br /> imaginary
      deity than to help your fellow-men.<br /> <br /> I regard the rights of men
      and women equal. In<br /> Love's fair realm, husband and wife are king and<br />
      queen, sceptered and crowned alike, and seated on<br /> the self-same
      throne.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you still insist that the Old
      Testa-<br /> ment upholds polygamy? Mr. Talmage denies this<br /> charge,
      and shows how terribly God punished those<br /> who were not satisfied with
      one wife.<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I see nothing in what Mr. Talmage has<br />
      said calculated to change my opinion. It has been<br /> <br /> 67<br /> <br />
      admitted by thousands of theologians that the Old<br /> Testament upholds
      polygamy. Mr. Talmage is<br /> among the first to deny it. It will not do
      to say that<br /> David was punished for the crime of polygamy<br /> or
      concubinage. He was "a man after God's own<br /> "heart." He was made a
      king. He was a successful<br /> general, and his blood is said to have
      flowed in the<br /> veins of God. Solomon was, according to the ac-<br />
      count, enriched with wisdom above all human beings.<br /> Was that a
      punishment for having had so many<br /> wives? Was Abraham pursued by the
      justice of<br /> God because of the crime against Hagar, or for the<br />
      crime against his own wife? The verse quoted by<br /> Mr. Talmage to show
      that God was opposed to<br /> polygamy, namely, the eighteenth verse of the
      eight-<br /> eenth chapter of Leviticus, cannot by any ingenuity<br /> be
      tortured into a command against polygamy. The<br /> most that can be
      possibly said of it is, that you shall<br /> not marry the sister of your
      wife, while your wife is<br /> living. Yet this passage is quoted by Mr.
      Talmage<br /> as "a thunder of prohibition against having more<br /> "than
      one wife." In the twentieth chapter of<br /> Leviticus it is enacted: "That
      if a man take a wife<br /> "and her mother they shall be burned with fire."
      A<br /> commandment like this shows that he might take his<br /> <br /> 68<br />
      <br /> wife and somebody else's mother. These passages<br /> have nothing to
      do with polygamy. They show<br /> whom you may marry, not how many; and
      there is<br /> not in Leviticus a solitary word against polygamy&mdash;<br />
      not one. Nor is there such a word in Genesis, nor<br /> Exodus, nor in the
      entire Pentateuch&mdash;not one<br /> word. These books are filled with the
      most minute<br /> directions about killing sheep, and goats and doves;<br />
      about making clothes for priests, about fashioning<br /> tongs and
      snuffers; and yet, they contain not one<br /> word against polygamy. It
      never occurred to the in-<br /> spired writers that polygamy was a crime.
      Polygamy<br /> was accepted as a matter of course. Women were<br /> simple
      property.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage, however, insists that, although God<br />
      was against polygamy, he permitted it, and at the<br /> same time threw his
      moral influence against it.<br /> Upon this subject he says: "No doubt God
      per-<br /> "mitted polygamy to continue for sometime, just<br /> "as he
      permits murder and arson, theft and gam-<br /> "bling to-day to continue,
      although he is against<br /> "them." If God is the author of the Ten Com-<br />
      mandments, he prohibited murder and theft, but<br /> he said nothing about
      polygamy. If he was so<br /> terribly against that crime, why did he forget
      to<br /> <br /> 69<br /> <br /> mention it? Was there not room enough on the<br />
      tables of stone for just one word on this subject?<br /> Had he no time to
      give a commandment against<br /> slavery? Mr. Talmage of course insists
      that God<br /> had to deal with these things gradually, his idea being<br />
      that if God had made a commandment against them all<br /> at once, the Jews
      would have had nothing more to do<br /> with him.<br /> <br /> For instance:
      if we wanted to break cannibals<br /> of eating missionaries, we should not
      tell them all<br /> at once that it was wrong, that it was wicked, to<br />
      eat missionaries raw; we should induce them first<br /> to cook the
      missionaries, and gradually wean them<br /> from raw flesh. This would be
      the first great step.<br /> We would stew the missionaries, and after a
      time<br /> put a little mutton in the stew, not enough to excite<br /> the
      suspicion of the cannibal, but just enough to get<br /> him in the habit of
      eating mutton without knowing it.<br /> Day after day we would put in more
      mutton and less<br /> missionary, until finally, the cannibal would be
      perfectly<br /> satisfied with clear mutton. Then we would tell him<br />
      that it was wrong to eat missionary. After the can-<br /> nibal got so that
      he liked mutton, and cared nothing<br /> for missionary, then it would be
      safe to have a law<br /> upon the subject.<br /> <br /> 70<br /> <br /> Mr.
      Talmage insists that polygamy cannot exist<br /> among people who believe
      the Bible. In this he is<br /> mistaken. The Mormons all believe the Bible.
      There<br /> is not a single polygamist in Utah who does not insist<br />
      upon the inspiration of the Old and New Testaments.<br /> <br /> The Rev.
      Mr. Newman, a kind of peripatetic consu-<br /> lar theologian, once had a
      discussion, I believe, with<br /> Elder Orson Pratt, at Salt Lake City,
      upon the question<br /> of polygamy. It is sufficient to say of this
      discussion<br /> that it is now circulated by the Mormons as a campaign<br />
      document. The elder overwhelmed the parson.<br /> Passages of Scripture in
      favor of polygamy were<br /> quoted by the hundred. The lives of all the
      patriarchs<br /> were brought forward, and poor parson Newman was<br />
      driven from the field. The truth is, the Jews at that<br /> time were much
      like our forefathers. They were<br /> barbarians, and many of their laws
      were unjust<br /> and cruel. Polygamy was the right of all; practiced,<br />
      as a matter of fact, by the rich and powerful, and the<br /> rich and
      powerful were envied by the poor. In such<br /> esteem did the ancient Jews
      hold polygamy, that the<br /> number of Solomons wives was given, simply to
      en-<br /> hance his glory. My own opinion is, that Solomon<br /> had very
      few wives, and that polygamy was not<br /> general in Palestine. The
      country was too poor, and<br /> <br /> 71<br /> <br /> Solomon, in all his
      glory was hardly able to support<br /> one wife. He was a poor barbarian
      king with a<br /> limited revenue, with a poor soil, with a sparse popu-<br />
      lation, without art, without science and without power.<br /> He sustained
      about the same relation to other kings<br /> that Delaware does to other
      States. Mr. Talmage<br /> says that God persecuted Solomon, and yet, if he
      will<br /> turn to the twenty-second chapter of First Chronicles,<br /> he
      will find what God promised to Solomon. God,<br /> speaking to David, says:
      "Behold a son shall be born<br /> "to thee, who shall be a man of rest, and
      I will give him<br /> "rest from his enemies around about; for his name
      shall<br /> "be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness<br /> "unto
      Israel in his days. He shall build a house in my<br /> "name, and he shall
      be my son and I will be his father,<br /> "and I will establish the throne
      of his kingdom over<br /> "Israel forever." Did God keep his promise?<br />
      <br /> So he tells us that David was persecuted by<br /> God, on account of
      his offences, and yet I find in<br /> the twenty-eighth verse of the
      twenty-ninth chapter<br /> of First Chronicles, the following account of
      the death<br /> of David: "And he died in a good old age, full of<br />
      "days, riches and honor." Is this true?<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What
      have you to say to the charge<br /> that you were mistaken in the number of
      years that<br /> <br /> 72<br /> <br /> the Hebrews were in Egypt? Mr. Talmage
      says that<br /> they were there 430 years, instead of 215 years.<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. If you will read the third chapter of<br /> Galatians,
      sixteenth and seventeenth verses, you will<br /> find that it was 430 years
      from the time God made the<br /> promise to Abraham to the giving of the
      law from<br /> Mount Sinai. The Hebrews did not go to Egypt for<br /> 215
      years after the promise was made to Abraham,<br /> and consequently did not
      remain in Egypt more than<br /> 215 years. If Galatians is true, I am
      right.<br /> <br /> Strange that Mr. Talmage should belittle the mira-<br />
      cles. The trouble with this defender of the faith is that<br /> he cares
      nothing for facts. He makes the strangest<br /> statements, and cares the
      least for proof, of any<br /> man I know. I can account for what he says of
      me<br /> only upon the supposition that he has not read my<br /> lectures.
      He may have been misled by the pirated<br /> editions; Persons have stolen
      my lectures, printed the<br /> same ones under various names, and filled
      them with<br /> mistakes and things I never said. Mr. C. P. Farrell,<br />
      of Washington, is my only authorized publisher.<br /> Yet Mr. Talmage
      prefers to answer the mistakes of<br /> literary thieves, and charge their
      ignorance to me.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did you ever attack the
      character of<br /> Queen Victoria, or did you draw any parallel between<br />
      <br /> 73<br /> <br /> her and George Eliot, calculated to depreciate the<br />
      reputation of the Queen?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I never said a word
      against Victoria.<br /> The fact is, I am not acquainted with her&mdash;never
      met<br /> her in my life, and know but little of her. I never<br /> happened
      to see her "in plain clothes, reading the<br /> "Bible to the poor in the
      lane,"&mdash;neither did I ever<br /> hear her sing. I most cheerfully
      admit that her<br /> reputation is good in the neighborhood where she<br />
      resides. In one of my lectures I drew a parallel<br /> between George Eliot
      and Victoria. I was showing<br /> the difference between a woman who had
      won her<br /> position in the world of thought, and one who was<br /> queen
      by chance. This is what I said:<br /> <br /> "It no longer satisfies the
      ambition of a great man<br /> "to be a king or emperor. The last Napoleon
      was<br /> "not satisfied with being the Emperor of the French.<br /> "He was
      not satisfied with having a circlet of gold<br /> "about his head&mdash;he
      wanted some evidence that he<br /> "had something of value in his head. So
      he wrote<br /> "the life of Julius C&aelig;sar that he might become a<br />
      "member of the French Academy. The emperors,<br /> "the kings, the popes,
      no longer tower above their<br /> "fellows. Compare King William with the
      philoso-<br /> "pher H&aelig;ckel. The king is one of the 'anointed<br />
      <br /> 74<br /> <br /> "'of the Most High'&mdash;as they claim&mdash;one upon<br />
      "whose head has been poured the divine petroleum<br /> "of authority.
      Compare this king with H&aelig;ckel, who<br /> "towers an intellectual
      Colossus above the crowned<br /> "mediocrity. Compare George Eliot with
      Queen<br /> "Victoria. The queen is clothed in garments given<br /> "her by
      blind fortune and unreasoning chance, while<br /> "George Eliot wears robes
      of glory, woven in the<br /> "loom of her own genius. The world is
      beginning<br /> "to pay homage to intellect, to genius, to heart."<br /> I
      said not one word against Queen Victoria, and did<br /> not intend to even
      intimate that she was not an ex-<br /> cellent woman, wife and mother. I
      was simply trying<br /> to show that the world was getting great enough to<br />
      place a genius above an accidental queen. Mr. Tal-<br /> mage, true to the
      fawning, cringing spirit of ortho-<br /> doxy, lauds the living queen and
      cruelly maligns the<br /> genius dead. He digs open the grave of George
      Eliot,<br /> and tries to stain the sacred dust of one who was the<br />
      greatest woman England has produced. He calls her<br /> "an adultress." He
      attacks her because she was an<br /> atheist&mdash;because she abhorred
      Jehovah, denied the<br /> inspiration of the Bible, denied the dogma of
      eternal<br /> pain, and with all her heart despised the Presbyterian<br />
      creed. He hates her because she was great and brave<br /> <br /> 75<br />
      <br /> and free&mdash;because she lived without "faith" and died<br />
      without fear&mdash;because she dared to give her honest<br /> thought, and
      grandly bore the taunts and slanders of<br /> the Christian world.<br />
      <br /> George Eliot tenderly carried in her heart the<br /> burdens of our
      race. She looked through pity's tears<br /> upon the faults and frailties
      of mankind. She knew<br /> the springs and seeds of thought and deed, and
      saw,<br /> with cloudless eyes, through all the winding ways of<br /> greed,
      ambition and deceit, where folly vainly plucks<br /> with thorn-pierced
      hands the fading flowers of selfish<br /> joy&mdash;the highway of eternal
      right. Whatever her<br /> relations may have been&mdash;no matter what I
      think, or<br /> others say, or how much all regret the one mistake in<br />
      all her self-denying, loving life&mdash;I feel and know that<br /> in the
      court where her own conscience sat as judge, she<br /> stood acquitted&mdash;pure
      as light and stainless as a star.<br /> <br /> How appropriate here, with
      some slight change,<br /> the wondrously poetic and pathetic words of
      Laertes<br /> at Ophelia's grave:<br /> <br /> <i>Leave her i' the earth;<br />
      And from her fair and unpolluted flesh<br /> May violets spring!<br /> I
      tell thee, churlish priest,<br /> A ministering angel shall this woman be,<br />
      When thou liest howling!</i><br /> <br /> I have no words with which to tell
      my loathing for<br /> a man who violates a noble woman's grave.<br /> <br />
      76<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you think that the spirit in which<br />
      Mr. Talmage reviews your lectures is in accordance<br /> with the teachings
      of Christianity?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I think that he talks like a
      true Presby-<br /> terian. If you will read the arguments of Calvin<br />
      against the doctrines of Castalio and Servetus, you will<br /> see that Mr.
      Talmage follows closely in the footsteps<br /> of the founder of his
      church. Castalio was such a<br /> wicked and abandoned wretch, that he
      taught the<br /> innocence of honest error. He insisted that God<br /> would
      not eternally damn a man for being honestly<br /> mistaken. For the
      utterance of such blasphemous<br /> sentiments, abhorrent to every
      Christian mind, Calvin<br /> called him "a dog of Satan, and a child of
      hell." In<br /> short, he used the usual arguments. Castalio was<br />
      banished, and died in exile. In the case of Servetus,<br /> after all the
      epithets had been exhausted, an appeal<br /> was made to the stake, and the
      blasphemous wretch<br /> was burned to ashes.<br /> <br /> If you will read
      the life of John Knox, you will find<br /> that Mr. Talmage is as orthodox
      in his methods of<br /> dealing with infidels, as he is in his creed. In my<br />
      opinion, he would gladly treat unbelievers now, as the<br /> Puritans did
      the Quakers, as the Episcopalians did the<br /> Presbyterians, as the
      Presbyterians did the Baptists,<br /> <br /> 77<br /> <br /> and as the
      Catholics have treated all heretics. Of<br /> course, all these sects will
      settle their differences in<br /> heaven. In the next world, they will
      laugh at the<br /> crimes they committed in this.<br /> <br /> The course
      pursued by Mr. Talmage is consistent.<br /> The pulpit cannot afford to
      abandon the weapons of<br /> falsehood and defamation. Candor sows the
      seeds of<br /> doubt. Fairness is weakness. The only way to suc-<br />
      cessfully uphold the religion of universal love, is to<br /> denounce all
      Freethinkers as blasphemers, adulterers,<br /> and criminals. No matter how
      generous they may<br /> appear to be, no matter how fairly they may deal
      with<br /> their fellow-men, rest assured that they are actuated<br /> by
      the lowest and basest motives. Infidels who out-<br /> wardly live honest
      and virtuous lives, are inwardly<br /> vicious, virulent and vile. After
      all, morality is only<br /> a veneering. God is not deceived with the
      varnish of<br /> good works. We know that the natural man is<br /> totally
      depraved, and that until he has been regene-<br /> rated by the spirit of
      God, he is utterly incapable of a<br /> good action. The generosity of the
      unbeliever is, in<br /> fact, avarice. His honesty is only a form of
      larceny.<br /> His love is only hatred. No matter how sincerely<br /> he may
      love his wife,&mdash;how devoted he may be to<br /> his children,&mdash;no
      matter how ready he may be 'to<br /> <br /> 78<br /> <br /> sacrifice even his
      life for the good of mankind, God,<br /> looking into his very heart, finds
      it only a den of<br /> hissing snakes, a lair of wild, ferocious beasts, a
      cage<br /> of unclean birds.<br /> <br /> The idea that God will save a man
      simply because<br /> he is honest and generous, is almost too preposterous<br />
      for serious refutation. No man should rely upon his<br /> own goodness. He
      should plead the virtue of another.<br /> God, in his infinite justice,
      damns a good man on his<br /> own merits, and saves a bad man on the merits
      of<br /> another. The repentant murderer will be an angel<br /> of light,
      while his honest and unoffending victim will<br /> be a fiend in hell.<br />
      <br /> A little while ago, a ship, disabled, was blown about<br /> the
      Atlantic for eighty days. Everything had been<br /> eaten. Nothing remained
      but bare decks and hunger.<br /> The crew consisted of Captain Kruger and
      nine others.<br /> For nine days, nothing had been eaten. The captain,<br />
      taking a revolver in his hand, said: "Mates, some<br /> "one must die for
      the rest. I am willing to sacrifice<br /> "myself for you." One of his
      comrades grasped his<br /> hand, and implored him to wait one more day. The<br />
      next morning, a sail was seen upon the horizon, and<br /> the dying men
      were rescued.<br /> <br /> To an ordinary man,&mdash;to one guided by the
      light of<br /> <br /> 79<br /> <br /> reason,&mdash;it is perfectly clear that
      Captain Kruger was<br /> about to do an infinitely generous action. Yet Mr.<br />
      Talmage will tell us that if that captain was not a<br /> Christian, and if
      he had sent the bullet crashing<br /> through his brain in order that his
      comrades might eat<br /> his body, and live to reach their wives and homes,&mdash;<br />
      his soul, from that ship, would have gone, by dark<br /> and tortuous ways,
      down to the prison of eternal pain.<br /> <br /> Is it possible that Christ
      would eternally damn a<br /> man for doing exactly what Christ would have
      done,<br /> had he been infinitely generous, under the same cir-<br />
      cumstances? Is not self-denial in a man as praise-<br /> worthy as in a
      God? Should a God be worshiped,<br /> and a man be damned, for the same
      action?<br /> <br /> According to Mr. Talmage, every soldier who fought<br />
      for our country in the Revolutionary war, who was<br /> not a Christian, is
      now in hell. Every soldier, not a<br /> Christian, who carried the flag of
      his country to vic-<br /> tory&mdash;either upon the land or sea, in the
      war of 1812,<br /> is now in hell. Every soldier, not a Christian, who<br />
      fought for the preservation of this Union,&mdash;to break<br /> the chains
      of slavery&mdash;to free four millions of people<br /> &mdash;to keep the
      whip from the naked back&mdash;every man<br /> who did this&mdash;every one
      who died at Andersonville<br /> and Libby, dreaming that his death would
      help make<br /> <br /> 80<br /> <br /> the lives of others worth living, is
      now a lost and<br /> wretched soul. These men are now in the prison of<br />
      God,&mdash;a prison in which the cruelties of Libby and<br /> Andersonville
      would be regarded as mercies,&mdash;in<br /> which famine would be a joy.<br />

      <br /> Parson. Because he is unchangeable.</i><br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      I want to ask you a few questions<br /> about Mr. Talmage's third sermon.
      What do<br /> you think of it?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I often ask myself
      the questions: Is<br /> there anything in the occupation of a minister,&mdash;any-<br />
      thing in his surroundings, that makes him incapable<br /> of treating an
      opponent fairly, or decently? Is there<br /> anything in the doctrine of
      universal forgiveness that<br /> compels a man to speak of one who differs
      with him<br /> only in terms of disrespect and hatred? Is it neces-<br />
      sary for those who profess to love the whole world,<br /> to hate the few
      they come in actual contact with?<br /> <br /> 84<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage, no
      doubt, professes to love all man-<br /> kind,&mdash;Jew and Gentile,
      Christian and Pagan. No<br /> doubt, he believes in the missionary effort,
      and thinks<br /> we should do all in our power to save the soul of the<br />
      most benighted savage; and yet he shows anything<br /> but affection for
      the "heathen" at home. He loves<br /> the ones he never saw,&mdash;is real
      anxious for their wel-<br /> fare,&mdash;but for the ones he knows, he
      exhibits only<br /> scorn and hatred. In one breath, he tells us that<br />
      Christ loves us, and in the next, that we are "wolves<br /> "and dogs." We
      are informed that Christ forgave<br /> even his murderers, but that now he
      hates an honest<br /> unbeliever with all his heart. He can forgive the<br />
      ones who drove the nails into his hands and feet,&mdash;<br /> the one who
      thrust the spear through his quivering<br /> flesh,&mdash;but he cannot
      forgive the man who entertains<br /> an honest doubt about the "scheme of
      salvation."<br /> He regards the man who thinks, as a "mouth-maker<br /> "at
      heaven." Is it possible that Christ is less for-<br /> giving in heaven
      than he was in Jerusalem? Did he<br /> excuse murderers then, and does he
      damn thinkers<br /> now? Once he pitied even thieves; does he now<br />
      abhor an intellectually honest man?<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr.
      Talmage seems to think that you<br /> have no right to give your opinion
      about the Bible.<br /> <br /> 85<br /> <br /> Do you think that laymen have
      the same right as<br /> ministers to examine the Scriptures?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      If God only made a revelation for<br /> preachers, of course we will have
      to depend on the<br /> preachers for information. But the preachers have<br />
      made the mistake of showing the revelation. They<br /> ask us, the laymen,
      to read it, and certainly there is<br /> no use of reading it, unless we
      are permitted to think<br /> for ourselves while we read. If after reading
      the Bible<br /> we believe it to be true, we will say so, if we are<br />
      honest. If we do not believe it, we will say so, if we<br /> are honest.<br />
      <br /> But why should God be so particular about our<br /> believing the
      stories in his book? Why should God<br /> object to having his book
      examined? We do not<br /> have to call upon legislators, or courts, to
      protect<br /> Shakespeare from the derision of mankind. Was not<br /> God
      able to write a book that would command the<br /> love and admiration of
      the world? If the God of<br /> Mr. Talmage is infinite, he knew exactly how
      the<br /> stories of the Old Testament would strike a gentle-<br /> man of
      the nineteenth century. He knew that many<br /> would have their doubts,&mdash;that
      thousands of them&mdash;<br /> and I may say most of them,&mdash;would
      refuse to believe<br /> that a miracle had ever been performed.<br /> <br />
      86<br /> <br /> Now, it seems to me that he should either have left<br /> the
      stories out, or furnished evidence enough to con-<br /> vince the world.
      According to Mr. Talmage, thou-<br /> sands of people are pouring over the
      Niagara of<br /> unbelief into the gulf of eternal pain. Why does not<br />
      God furnish more evidence? Just in proportion as<br /> man has developed
      intellectually, he has demanded<br /> additional testimony. That which
      satisfies a barbarian,<br /> excites only the laughter of a civilized man.
      Cer-<br /> tainly God should furnish evidence in harmony with<br /> the
      spirit of the age. If God wrote his Bible for the<br /> average man, he
      should have written it in such a way<br /> that it would have carried
      conviction to the brain and<br /> heart of the average man; and he should
      have<br /> made no man in such a way that he could not, by any<br />
      possibility, believe it. There certainly should be a<br /> harmony between
      the Bible and the human brain. If<br /> I do not believe the Bible, whose
      fault is it? Mr.<br /> Talmage insists that his God wrote the Bible for me.<br />
      and made me. If this is true, the book and the man<br /> should agree.
      There is no sense in God writing<br /> a book for me and then making me in
      such a way that<br /> I cannot believe his book.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      But Mr. Talmage says the reason why<br /> you hate the Bible is, that your
      soul is poisoned; that<br /> <br /> 87<br /> <br /> the Bible "throws you into
      a rage precisely as pure<br /> "water brings on a paroxysm of hydrophobia."<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Is it because the mind of the infidel is<br />
      poisoned, that he refuses to believe that an infinite<br /> God commanded
      the murder of mothers, maidens and<br /> babes? Is it because their minds
      are impure, that<br /> they refuse to believe that a good God established<br />
      the institution of human slavery, or that he protected<br /> it when
      established? Is it because their minds are<br /> vile, that they refuse to
      believe that an infinite God<br /> established or protected polygamy? Is it
      a sure<br /> sign of an impure mind, when a man insists that<br /> God never
      waged wars of extermination against his<br /> helpless children? Does it
      show that a man has<br /> been entirely given over to the devil, because he<br />
      refuses to believe that God ordered a father to sacri-<br /> fice his son?
      Does it show that a heart is entirely<br /> without mercy, simply because a
      man denies the<br /> justice of eternal pain?<br /> <br /> I denounce many
      parts of the Old Testament<br /> because they are infinitely repugnant to
      my sense<br /> of justice,&mdash;because they are bloody, brutal and in-<br />
      famous,&mdash;because they uphold crime and destroy<br /> human liberty. It
      is impossible for me to imagine<br /> a greater monster than the God of the
      Old Testa-<br /> <br /> 88<br /> <br /> ment. He is unworthy of my worship. He
      com-<br /> mands only my detestation, my execration, and my<br /> passionate
      hatred. The God who commanded the<br /> murder of children is an infamous
      fiend. The God<br /> who believed in polygamy, is worthy only of con-<br />
      tempt. The God who established slavery should be<br /> hated by every free
      man. The Jehovah of the Jews<br /> was simply a barbarian, and the Old
      Testament is<br /> mostly the barbarous record of a barbarous people.<br />
      <br /> If the Jehovah of the Jews is the real God, I do<br /> not wish to be
      his friend. From him I neither ask,<br /> nor expect, nor would I be
      willing to receive, even an<br /> eternity of joy. According to the Old
      Testament,<br /> he established a government,&mdash;a political state,&mdash;and<br />
      yet, no civilized country to-day would re-enact these<br /> laws of God.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. What do you think of the explanation<br /> given by
      Mr. Talmage of the stopping of the sun and<br /> moon in the time of
      Joshua, in order that a battle<br /> might be completed?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Of course, if there is an infinite God,<br /> he could have stopped the sun
      and moon. No one<br /> pretends to prescribe limits to the power of the<br />
      infinite. Even admitting that such a being existed,<br /> the question
      whether he did stop the sun and moon,<br /> <br /> 89<br /> <br /> or not,
      still remains. According to the account, these<br /> planets were stopped,
      in order that Joshua might con-<br /> tinue the pursuit of a routed enemy.
      I take it for<br /> granted that a being of infinite wisdom would not<br />
      waste any force,&mdash;that he would not throw away any<br />
      "omnipotence," and that, under ordinary circum-<br /> stances, he would
      husband his resources. I find that<br /> this spirit exists, at least in
      embryo, in Mr. Talmage.<br /> He proceeds to explain this miracle. He does
      not<br /> assert that the earth was stopped on its axis, but sug-<br />
      gests "refraction" as a way out of the difficulty. Now,<br /> while the
      stopping of the earth on its axis accounts for<br /> the sun remaining in
      the same relative position, it does<br /> not account for the stoppage of
      the moon. The moon<br /> has a motion of its own, and even if the earth had
      been<br /> stopped in its rotary motion, the moon would have gone<br /> on.
      The Bible tells us that the moon was stopped. One<br /> would suppose that
      the sun would have given sufficient<br /> light for all practical purposes.
      Will Mr. Talmage be<br /> kind enough to explain the stoppage of the moon?<br />
      Every one knows that the moon is somewhat obscure<br /> when the sun is in
      the midst of the heavens. The moon<br /> when compared with the sun at such
      a time, is much<br /> like one of the discourses of Mr. Talmage side by
      side<br /> with a chapter from Humboldt;&mdash;it is useless.<br /> <br /> 90<br />
      <br /> In the same chapter in which the account of the<br /> stoppage of the
      sun and moon is given, we find that<br /> God cast down from heaven great
      hailstones on<br /> Joshua's enemies. Did he get out of hailstones?<br />
      Had he no "omnipotence" left? Was it necessary<br /> for him to stop the
      sun and moon and depend entirely<br /> upon the efforts of Joshua? Would
      not the force<br /> employed in stopping the rotary motion of the earth<br />
      have been sufficient to destroy the enemy? Would<br /> not a millionth part
      of the force necessary to stop the<br /> moon, have pierced the enemy's
      centre, and rolled up<br /> both his flanks? A resort to lightning would
      have<br /> been, in my judgment, much more economical and<br /> rather more
      effective. If he had simply opened the<br /> earth, and swallowed them, as
      he did Korah and his<br /> company, it would have been a vast saving of<br />
      "omnipotent" muscle. Yet, the foremost orthodox<br /> minister of the
      Presbyterian Church,&mdash;the one who<br /> calls all unbelievers "wolves
      and dogs," and "brazen<br /> "fools," in his effort to account for this
      miracle, is<br /> driven to the subterfuge of an "optical illusion."<br />
      We are seriously informed that "God probably<br /> "changed the nature of
      the air," and performed this<br /> feat of ledgerdemain through the
      instrumentality of<br /> "refraction." It seems to me it would have been
      fully<br /> <br /> 91<br /> <br /> as easy to have changed the nature of the
      air breathed<br /> by the enemy, so that it would not have supported<br />
      life. He could have accomplished this by changing<br /> only a little air,
      in that vicinity; whereas, according<br /> to the Talmagian view, he
      changed the atmosphere<br /> of the world. Or, a small "local flood" might
      have<br /> done the work. The optical illusion and refraction<br /> view,
      ingenious as it may appear, was not original<br /> with Mr. Talmage. The
      Rev. Henry M. Morey, of<br /> South Bend, Indiana, used, upon this subject,
      the fol-<br /> lowing language; "The phenomenon was simply<br /> "optical.
      The rotary motion of the earth was not<br /> "disturbed, but the light of
      the sun was prolonged by<br /> "the same laws of refraction and reflection
      by which<br /> "the sun now appears to be above the horizon when<br /> "it
      is really below. The medium through which the<br /> "sun's rays passed,
      might have been miraculously<br /> "influenced so as to have caused the sun
      to linger<br /> "above the horizon long after its usual time for dis-<br />
      "appearance."<br /> <br /> I pronounce the opinion of Mr. Morey to be the<br />
      ripest product of Christian scholarship. According to<br /> the
      Morey-Talmage view, the sun lingered somewhat<br /> above the horizon. But
      this is inconsistent with the<br /> Bible account. We are not told in the
      Scriptures that<br /> <br /> 92<br /> <br /> the sun "lingered above the
      horizon," but that it "stood<br /> "still in the midst of heaven for about
      a whole day."<br /> The trouble about the optical-illusion view is, that it<br />
      makes the day too long. If the air was miraculously<br /> changed, so that
      it refracted the rays of the sun, while<br /> the earth turned over as
      usual for about a whole day,<br /> then, at the end of that time, the sun
      must have been<br /> again visible in the east. It would then naturally<br />
      shine twelve hours more, so that this miraculous day<br /> must have been
      at least thirty-six hours in length.<br /> There were first twelve hours of
      natural light, then<br /> twelve hours of refracted and reflected light,
      and then<br /> twelve hours more of natural light. This makes the<br /> day
      too long. So, I say to Mr. Talmage, as I said to<br /> Mr. Morey: If you
      will depend a little less on<br /> refraction, and a little more on
      reflection, you will see<br /> that the whole story is a barbaric myth and
      foolish<br /> fable.<br /> <br /> For my part, I do not see why God should be<br />
      pleased to have me believe a story of this character.<br /> I can hardly
      think that there is great joy in heaven<br /> over another falsehood
      swallowed. I can imagine<br /> that a man may deny this story, and still be
      an excel-<br /> lent citizen, a good father, an obliging neighbor, and<br />
      in all respects a just and truthful man. I can also<br /> <br /> 93<br />
      <br /> imagine that a man may believe this story, and yet<br /> assassinate
      a President of the United States.<br /> <br /> I am afraid that Mr. Talmage
      is beginning to be<br /> touched, in spite of himself, with some new ideas.
      He<br /> tells us that worlds are born and that worlds die.<br /> This is
      not exactly the Bible view. You would think<br /> that he imagined that a
      world was naturally pro-<br /> duced,&mdash;that the aggregation of atoms
      was natural,<br /> and that disintegration came to worlds, as to men,<br />
      through old age. Yet this is not the Bible view.<br /> According to the
      Bible, these worlds were not born,&mdash;<br /> they were created out of
      "nothing," or out of<br /> "omnipotence," which is much the same. According<br />
      to the Bible, it took this infinite God six days to make<br /> this atom
      called earth; and according to the account,<br /> he did not work nights,&mdash;he
      worked from the morn-<br /> ings to the evenings,&mdash;and I suppose
      rested nights,<br /> as he has since that time on Sundays.<br /> <br />
      Admitting that the battle which Joshua fought<br /> was exceedingly
      important&mdash;which I do not think&mdash;<br /> is it not a little
      strange that this God, in all subse-<br /> quent battles of the world's
      history, of which we<br /> know anything, has maintained the strictest neu-<br />
      trality? The earth turned as usual at Yorktown,<br /> and at Gettysburg the
      moon pursued her usual<br /> <br /> 94<br /> <br /> course; and so far as I
      know, neither at Waterloo<br /> nor at Sedan were there any peculiar freaks
      of "re-<br /> "fraction" or "reflection."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr.
      Talmage tells us that there was in<br /> the early part of this century a
      dark day, when<br /> workmen went home from their fields, and legis-<br />
      latures and courts adjourned, and that the darkness<br /> of that day has
      not yet been explained. What is<br /> your opinion about that?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. My opinion is, that if at that time we<br /> had been at war
      with England, and a battle had<br /> been commenced in the morning, and in
      the after-<br /> noon the American forces had been driven from their<br />
      position and were hard pressed by the enemy, and<br /> if the day had
      become suddenly dark, and so dark<br /> that the Americans were thereby
      enabled to escape,<br /> thousands of theologians of the calibre of Mr.
      Tal-<br /> mage would have honestly believed that there had<br /> been an
      interposition of divine Providence. No<br /> battle was fought that day,
      and consequently, even<br /> the ministers are looking for natural causes.
      In<br /> olden times, when the heavens were visited by<br /> comets, war,
      pestilence and famine were predicted.<br /> If wars came, the prediction
      was remembered; if<br /> <br /> 95<br /> <br /> nothing happened, it was
      forgotten. When eclipses<br /> visited the sun and moon, the barbarian fell
      upon his<br /> knees, and accounted for the phenomena by the<br />
      wickedness of his neighbor. Mr. Talmage tells us<br /> that his father was
      terrified by the meteoric shower<br /> that visited our earth in 1833. The
      terror of the<br /> father may account for the credulity of the son.<br />
      Astronomers will be surprised to read the declaration<br /> of Mr. Talmage
      that the meteoric shower has never<br /> been explained. Meteors visit the
      earth every year<br /> of its life, and in a certain portion of the orbit
      they<br /> are always expected, and they always come. Mr.<br /> Newcomb has
      written a work on astronomy that<br /> all ministers ought to read.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage also charges you with<br /> "making
      light of holy things," and seems to be aston-<br /> ished that you should
      ridicule the anointing oil of<br /> Aaron?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I find
      that the God who had no time to<br /> say anything on the subject of
      slavery, and who found<br /> no room upon the tables of stone to say a word<br />
      against polygamy, and in favor of the rights of<br /> woman, wife and
      mother, took time to give a recipe<br /> for making hair oil. And in order
      that the priests<br /> <br /> 96<br /> <br /> might have the exclusive right
      to manufacture this oil,<br /> decreed the penalty of death on all who
      should<br /> infringe. I admit that I am incapable of seeing the<br />
      beauty of this symbol. Neither could I ever see the<br /> necessity of
      Masons putting oil on the corner-stone<br /> of a building. Of course, I do
      not know the exact<br /> chemical effect that oil has on stone, and I see
      no harm<br /> in laughing at such a ceremony. If the oil does good,<br />
      the laughter will do no harm; and if the oil will do no<br /> harm, the
      laughter will do no good. Personally, I am<br /> willing that Masons should
      put oil on all stones; but,<br /> if Masons should insist that I must
      believe in the effi-<br /> cacy of the ceremony, or be eternally damned, I<br />
      would have about the same feeling toward the<br /> Masons that I now have
      toward Mr. Talmage. I<br /> presume that at one time the putting of oil on
      a<br /> corner-stone had some meaning; but that it ever did<br /> any good,
      no sensible man will insist. It is a custom<br /> to break a bottle of
      champagne over the bow of<br /> a newly-launched ship, but I have never
      considered<br /> this ceremony important to the commercial interests<br />
      of the world.<br /> <br /> I have the same opinion about putting oil on<br />
      stones, as about putting water on heads. For my<br /> part, I see no good
      in the rite of baptism. Still, it<br /> <br /> 97<br /> <br /> may do no harm,
      unless people are immersed during<br /> cold weather. Neither have I the
      slightest objection<br /> to the baptism of anybody; but if people tell me
      that<br /> I must be baptized or suffer eternal agony, then I deny<br /> it.
      If they say that baptism does any earthly good, I<br /> deny it. No one
      objects to any harmless ceremony;<br /> but the moment it is insisted that
      a ceremony is neces-<br /> sary, the reason of which no man can see, then
      the<br /> practice of the ceremony becomes hurtful, for the<br /> reason
      that it is maintained only at the expense of<br /> intelligence and
      manhood.<br /> <br /> It is hurtful for people to imagine that they can<br />
      please God by any ceremony whatever. If there is<br /> any God, there is
      only one way to please him, and<br /> that is, by a conscientious discharge
      of your obliga-<br /> tions to your fellow-men. Millions of people imagine<br />
      that they can please God by wearing certain kinds<br /> of cloth. Think of
      a God who can be pleased with<br /> a coat of a certain cut! Others, to
      earn a smile of<br /> heaven, shave their heads, or trim their beards, or<br />
      perforate their ears or lips or noses. Others maim<br /> and mutilate their
      bodies. Others think to please<br /> God by simply shutting their eyes, by
      swinging<br /> censers, by lighting candles, by repeating poor Latin,<br />
      by making a sign of the cross with holy water, by<br /> <br /> 98<br /> <br />
      ringing bells, by going without meat, by eating fish,<br /> by getting
      hungry, by counting beads, by making<br /> themselves miserable Sundays, by
      looking solemn,<br /> by refusing to marry, by hearing sermons; and<br />
      others imagine that they can please God by calumni-<br /> ating
      unbelievers.<br /> <br /> There is an old story of an Irishman who, when<br />
      dying, sent for a priest. The reputation of the<br /> dying man was so
      perfectly miserable, that the priest<br /> refused to administer the rite
      of extreme unction.<br /> The priest therefore asked him if he could
      recollect<br /> any decent action that he had ever done. The dying<br /> man
      said that he could not. "Very well," said the<br /> priest, "then you will
      have to be damned." In a<br /> moment, the pinched and pale face
      brightened, and<br /> he said to the priest: "I have thought of one good<br />
      "action." "What is it?" asked the priest. And the<br /> dying man said,
      "Once I killed a gauger."<br /> <br /> I suppose that in the next world some
      ministers,<br /> driven to extremes, may reply: "Once I told a lie<br />
      "about an infidel."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. You see that Mr. Talmage
      still sticks to<br /> the whale and Jonah story. What do you think of<br />
      his argument, or of his explanation, rather, of that<br /> miracle?<br />
      <br /> 99<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The edge of his orthodoxy seems to be<br />
      crumbling. He tells us that "there is in the mouth<br /> "of the common
      whale a cavity large enough for a<br /> "man to live in without descent
      into his stomach,"&mdash;<br /> and yet Christ says, that Jonah was in the
      whale's<br /> belly, not in his mouth. But why should Mr. Tal-<br /> mage
      say that? We are told in the sacred account<br /> that "God prepared a
      great fish" for the sole pur-<br /> pose of having Jonah swallowed. The
      size of the<br /> present whale has nothing to do with the story. No<br />
      matter whether the throat of the whale of to-day is<br /> large or small,&mdash;that
      has nothing to do with it. The<br /> simple story is, that God prepared a
      fish and had<br /> Jonah swallowed. And yet Mr. Talmage throws out<br /> the
      suggestion that probably this whale held Jonah<br /> in his mouth for three
      days and nights. I admit that<br /> Jonah's chance for air would have been
      a little better<br /> in his mouth, and his chance for water a little
      worse.<br /> Probably the whale that swallowed Jonah was the<br /> same fish
      spoken of by Procopius,&mdash;both accounts<br /> being entitled, in my
      judgment, to equal credence.<br /> I am a little surprised that Mr. Talmage
      forgot<br /> to mention the fish spoken of by Munchausen&mdash;an<br />
      equally reliable author,&mdash;and who has given, not<br /> simply the bald
      fact that a fish swallowed a ship, but<br /> <br /> 100<br /> <br /> was good
      enough to furnish the details. Mr. Talmage<br /> should remember that out
      of Jonah's biography<br /> grew the habit of calling any remarkable lie, "a
      fish<br /> "story." There is one thing that Mr. Talmage<br /> should not
      forget; and that is, that miracles should<br /> not be explained. Miracles
      are told simply to be<br /> believed, not to be understood.<br /> <br />
      Somebody suggested to Mr. Talmage that, in<br /> all probability, a person
      in the stomach of a whale<br /> would be digested in less than three days.
      Mr. Tal-<br /> mage, again showing his lack of confidence in God,<br />
      refusing to believe that God could change the nature<br /> of gastric
      juice,&mdash;having no opportunity to rely<br /> upon "refraction or
      reflection," frankly admits that<br /> Jonah had to save himself by keeping
      on the<br /> constant go and jump. This gastric-juice theory of<br /> Mr.
      Talmage is an abandonment of his mouth hy-<br /> pothesis. I do not wonder
      that Mr. Talmage thought<br /> of the mouth theory. Possibly, the two
      theories had<br /> better be united&mdash;so that we may say that Jonah,<br />
      when he got tired of the activity necessary to<br /> avoid the gastric
      juice, could have strolled into<br /> the mouth for a rest. What a picture!
      Jonah<br /> sitting on the edge of the lower jaw, wiping the<br />
      perspiration and the gastric juice from his anxious<br /> <br /> 101<br />
      <br /> face, and vainly looking through the open mouth<br /> for signs of
      land!<br /> <br /> In this story of Jonah, we are told that "the Lord<br />
      "spake unto the fish." In what language? It must<br /> be remembered that
      this fish was only a few hours<br /> old. He had been prepared during the
      storm, for<br /> the sole purpose of swallowing Jonah. He was a<br /> fish
      of exceedingly limited experience. He had no<br /> hereditary knowledge,
      because he did not spring<br /> from ancestors; consequently, he had no
      instincts.<br /> Would such a fish understand any language? It<br /> may be
      contended that the fish, having been made<br /> for the occasion, was given
      a sufficient knowledge<br /> of language to understand an ordinary command-<br />
      ment; but, if Mr. Talmage is right, I think an order<br /> to the fish
      would have been entirely unnecessary.<br /> When we take into consideration
      that a thing the<br /> size of a man had been promenading up and down<br />
      the stomach of this fish for three days and three<br /> nights,
      successfully baffling the efforts of gastric<br /> juice, we can readily
      believe that the fish was as<br /> anxious to have Jonah go, as Jonah was
      to leave.<br /> <br /> But the whale part is, after all, not the most won-<br />
      derful portion of the book of Jonah. According to<br /> this wonderful
      account, "the word of the Lord came<br /> <br /> 102<br /> <br /> "to Jonah,"
      telling him to "go and cry against the<br /> "city of Nineveh;" but Jonah,
      instead of going,<br /> endeavored to evade the Lord by taking ship for<br />
      Tarshish. As soon as the Lord heard of this, he<br /> "sent out a great
      wind into the sea," and frightened<br /> the sailors to that extent that
      after assuring them-<br /> selves, by casting lots, that Jonah was the man,
      they<br /> threw him into the sea. After escaping from the<br /> whale, he
      went to Nineveh, and delivered his pre-<br /> tended message from God. In
      consequence of his<br /> message, Jonah having no credentials from God,&mdash;<br />
      nothing certifying to his official character, the King<br /> of Nineveh
      covered himself with sack-cloth and sat<br /> down in some ashes. He then
      caused a decree to<br /> be issued that every man and beast should abstain<br />
      from food and water; and further, that every man and<br /> beast should be
      covered with sack-cloth. This was<br /> done in the hope that Jonah's God
      would repent, and<br /> turn away his fierce anger. When we take into con-<br />
      sideration the fact that the people of Nineveh were<br /> not Hebrews, and
      had not the slightest confidence in<br /> the God of the Jews&mdash;knew no
      more of, and cared no<br /> more for, Jehovah than we now care for Jupiter,
      or<br /> Neptune; the effect produced by the proclamation of<br /> Jonah is,
      to say the least of it, almost incredible.<br /> <br /> 103<br /> <br /> We
      are also informed, in this book, that the<br /> moment God saw all the
      people sitting in the ashes,<br /> and all the animals covered with
      sack-cloth, he<br /> repented. This failure on the part of God to destroy<br />
      the unbelievers displeased Jonah exceedingly, and<br /> he was very angry.
      Jonah was much like the<br /> modern minister, who seems always to be
      personally<br /> aggrieved if the pestilence and famine prophesied by<br />
      him do not come. Jonah was displeased to that<br /> degree, that he asked
      God to kill him. Jonah then<br /> went out of the city, even after God had
      repented,<br /> made him a booth and sat under it, in the shade,<br />
      waiting to see what would become of the city. God<br /> then "prepared a
      gourd, and made it to come up<br /> "over Jonah that it might be a shadow
      over his<br /> "head to deliver him from his grief." And then we<br /> have
      this pathetic line: "So Jonah was exceedingly<br /> "glad of the gourd."<br />
      <br /> God having prepared a fish, and also prepared<br /> a gourd, proposed
      next morning to prepare a worm.<br /> And when the sun rose next day, the
      worm that<br /> God had prepared, "smote the gourd, so that<br /> "it
      withered." I can hardly believe that an in-<br /> finite being prepared a
      worm to smite a gourd<br /> so that it withered, in order to keep the sun
      from<br /> <br /> 104<br /> <br /> the bald head of a prophet. According to
      the<br /> account, after sunrise, and after the worm had<br /> smitten the
      gourd, "God prepared a vehement east<br /> "wind." This was not an ordinary
      wind, but one<br /> prepared expressly for that occasion. After the wind<br />
      had been prepared, "the sun beat upon the head of<br /> "Jonah, and he
      fainted, and wished in himself to<br /> "die." All this was done in order
      to convince<br /> Jonah that a man who would deplore the loss of a<br />
      gourd, ought not to wish for the destruction of a city.<br /> <br /> Is it
      possible for any intelligent man now to<br /> believe that the history of
      Jonah is literally true?<br /> For my part, I cannot see the necessity
      either of<br /> believing it, or of preaching it. It has nothing to do<br />
      with honesty, with mercy, or with morality. The<br /> bad may believe it,
      and the good may hold it in<br /> contempt. I do not see that civilization
      has the<br /> slightest interest in the fish, the gourd, the worm, or<br />
      the vehement east wind.<br /> <br /> Does Mr. Talmage think that it is
      absolutely neces-<br /> sary to believe <i>all</i> the story? Does he not
      think it<br /> probable that a God of infinite mercy, rather than<br /> damn
      the soul of an honest man to hell forever, would<br /> waive, for instance,
      the worm,&mdash;provided he believed<br /> in the vehement east wind, the
      gourd and the fish?<br /> <br /> 105<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage, by insisting on
      the literal truth of<br /> the Bible stories, is doing Christianity great
      harm.<br /> Thousands of young men will say: "I can't become<br /> "a
      Christian if it is necessary to believe the adven-<br /> "tures of Jonah."
      Mr. Talmage will put into the<br /> paths of multitudes of people willing
      to do right,<br /> anxious to make the world a little better than it is,&mdash;<br />
      this stumbling block. He could have explained it,<br /> called it an
      allegory, poetical license, a child of the<br /> oriental imagination, a
      symbol, a parable, a poem, a<br /> dream, a legend, a myth, a divine
      figure, or a great<br /> truth wrapped in the rags and shreds and patches
      of<br /> seeming falsehood. His efforts to belittle the miracle,<br /> to
      suggest the mouth instead of the stomach,&mdash;to<br /> suggest that Jonah
      took deck passage, or lodged in<br /> the forecastle instead of in the
      cabin or steerage,&mdash;<br /> to suggest motion as a means of avoiding
      digestion,<br /> is a serious theological blunder, and may cause the<br />
      loss of many souls.<br /> <br /> If Mr. Talmage will consult with other
      ministers,<br /> they will tell him to let this story alone&mdash;that he
      will<br /> simply "provoke investigation and discussion"&mdash;two<br />
      things to be avoided. They will tell him that they<br /> are not willing
      their salary should hang on so slender<br /> a thread, and will advise him
      not to bother his gourd<br /> <br /> 106<br /> <br /> about Jonah's. They will
      also tell him that in this<br /> age of the world, arguments cannot be
      answered by<br /> "a vehement east wind."<br /> <br /> Some people will think
      that it would have been<br /> just as easy for God to have pulled the gourd
      up, as<br /> to have prepared a worm to bite it.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Mr. Talmage charges that you have<br /> said there are indecencies in the
      Bible. Are you<br /> still of that opinion?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Mr.
      Talmage endeavors to evade the<br /> charge, by saying that "there are
      things in the Bible<br /> "not intended to be read, either in the family
      circle,<br /> "or in the pulpit, but nevertheless they are to be<br />
      "read." My own judgment is, that an infinite being<br /> should not inspire
      the writing of indecent things.<br /> It will not do to say, that the Bible
      description of sin<br /> "warns and saves." There is nothing in the history<br />
      of Tamar calculated to "warn and save and the<br /> same may be said of
      many other passages in the<br /> Old Testament. Most Christians would be
      glad<br /> to know that all such passages are interpolations.<br /> I regret
      that Shakespeare ever wrote a line that<br /> could not be read any where,
      and by any person.<br /> But Shakespeare, great as he was, did not rise en-<br />
      <br /> 107<br /> <br /> tirely above his time. So of most poets. Nearly all<br />
      have stained their pages with some vulgarity; and I<br /> am sorry for it,
      and hope the time will come when<br /> we shall have an edition of all the
      great writers and<br /> poets from which every such passage is elimi-<br />
      nated.<br /> <br /> It is with the Bible as with most other books. It<br />
      is a mingling of good and bad. There are many<br /> exquisite passages in
      the Bible,&mdash;many good laws,&mdash;<br /> many wise sayings,&mdash;and
      there are many passages<br /> that should never have been written. I do not
      pro-<br /> pose to throw away the good on account of the<br /> bad, neither
      do I propose to accept the bad on<br /> account of the good. The Bible need
      not be taken<br /> as an entirety. It is the business of every man who<br />
      reads it, to discriminate between that which is good<br /> and that which
      is bad. There are also many passages<br /> neither good nor bad,&mdash;wholly
      and totally indifferent<br /> &mdash;conveying 110 information&mdash;utterly
      destitute of<br /> ideas,&mdash;and as to these passages, my only objection<br />
      to them is that they waste time and paper.<br /> <br /> I am in favor of
      every passage in the Bible that<br /> conveys information. I am in favor of
      every wise<br /> proverb, of every verse coming from human ex-<br />
      perience and that appeals to the heart of man. I am<br /> <br /> 108<br />
      <br /> in favor of every passage that inculcates justice,<br /> generosity,
      purity, and mercy. I am satisfied that<br /> much of the historical part is
      false. Some of it<br /> is probably true. Let us have the courage to take<br />
      the true, and throw the false away. I am satisfied<br /> that many of the
      passages are barbaric, and many of<br /> them are good. Let us have the
      wisdom to accept<br /> the good and to reject the barbaric.<br /> <br /> No
      system of religion should go in partnership<br /> with barbarism. Neither
      should any Christian feel<br /> it his duty to defend the savagery of the
      past. The<br /> philosophy of Christ must stand independently of the<br />
      mistakes of the Old Testament. We should do jus-<br /> tice whether a woman
      was made from a rib or from<br /> "omnipotence." We should be merciful
      whether<br /> the flood was general, or local. We should be kind<br /> and
      obliging whether Jonah was swallowed by a fish<br /> or not. The miraculous
      has nothing to do with the<br /> moral. Intelligence is of more value than
      inspiration.<br /> Brain is better than Bible. Reason is above all<br />
      religion. I do not believe that any civilized human<br /> being clings to
      the Bible on account of its barbaric<br /> passages. I am candid enough to
      believe that every<br /> Christian in the world would think more of the
      Bible,<br /> if it had not upheld slavery, if it had denounced<br /> <br />
      109<br /> <br /> polygamy, if it had cried out against wars of exter-<br />
      mination, if it had spared women and babes, if it had<br /> upheld
      everywhere, and at all times, the standard of<br /> justice and mercy. But
      when it is claimed that the<br /> book is perfect, that it is inspired,
      that it is, in fact,<br /> the work of an infinitely wise and good God,&mdash;then<br />
      it should be without a defect. There should not be<br /> within its lids an
      impure word; it should not express<br /> an impure thought. There should
      not be one word<br /> in favor of injustice, not one word in favor of
      slavery,<br /> not one word in favor of wars of extermination.<br /> There
      must be another revision of the Scriptures.<br /> The chaff must be thrown
      away. The dross must<br /> be rejected; and only that be retained which is
      in<br /> exact harmony with the brain and heart of the<br /> greatest and
      the best.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage charges you with unfair-<br />
      ness, because you account for the death of art in<br /> Palestine, by the
      commandment which forbids the<br /> making of graven images.<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      I have said that that commandment was<br /> the death of art, and I say so
      still. I insist that by<br /> reason of that commandment, Palestine
      produced no<br /> painter and no sculptor until after the destruction of<br />
      <br /> 110<br /> <br /> Jerusalem. Mr. Talmage, in order to answer that<br />
      statement, goes on to show that hundreds and thou-<br /> sands of pictures
      were produced in the Middle Ages.<br /> That is a departure in pleading.
      Will he give us the<br /> names of the painters that existed in Palestine
      from<br /> Mount Sinai to the destruction of the temple? Will<br /> he give
      us the names of the sculptors between those<br /> times? Mohammed
      prohibited his followers from<br /> making any representation of human or
      animal life,<br /> and as a result, Mohammedans have never produced<br /> a
      painter nor a sculptor, except in the portrayal and<br /> chiseling of
      vegetable forms. They were confined<br /> to trees and vines, and flowers.
      No Mohammedan<br /> has portrayed the human face or form. But the<br />
      commandment of Jehovah went farther than that of<br /> Momammed, and
      prevented portraying the image of<br /> anything. The assassination of art
      was complete.<br /> <br /> There is another thing that should not be
      forgotten.<br /> <br /> We are indebted for the encouragement of<br /> art,
      not to the Protestant Church; if indebted to any,<br /> it is to the
      Catholic. The Catholic adorned the cathedral<br /> <br /> with painting and
      statue&mdash;not the Protestant.<br /> The Protestants opposed music and
      painting, and<br /> refused to decorate their temples. But if Mr. Tal-<br />
      mage wishes to know to whom we are indebted for<br /> <br /> 111<br /> <br />
      art, let him read the mythology of Greece and Rome.<br /> The early
      Christians destroyed paintings and statues.<br /> They were the enemies of
      all beauty. They hated<br /> and detested every expression of art. They
      looked<br /> upon the love of statues as a form of idolatry. They<br />
      looked upon every painting as a remnant of Pagan-<br /> ism. They destroyed
      all upon which they could lay<br /> their ignorant hands. Hundred of years
      afterwards,<br /> the world was compelled to search for the fragments<br />
      that Christian fury had left. The Greeks filled the<br /> world with
      beauty. For every stream and mountain<br /> and cataract they had a god or
      goddess. Their<br /> sculptors impersonated every dream and hope, and<br />
      their mythology feeds, to-day, the imagination of<br /> mankind. The Venus
      de Milo is the impersonation<br /> of beauty, in ruin&mdash;the sublimest
      fragment of the<br /> ancient world. Our mythology is infinitely unpoetic<br />
      and barren&mdash;our deity an old bachelor from eternity,<br /> who once
      believed in indiscriminate massacre. Upon<br /> the throne of our heaven,
      woman finds no place.<br /> Our mythology is destitute of the maternal.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage denies your statement<br /> that the Old
      Testament humiliates woman. He also<br /> denies that the New Testament
      says anything<br /> against woman. How is it?<br /> <br /> 112<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Of course, I never considered a book up-<br /> holding polygamy to be the
      friend of woman. Eve,<br /> according to that book, is the mother of us
      all, and<br /> yet the inspired writer does not tell us how long she<br />
      lived,&mdash;does not even mention her death,&mdash;makes<br /> not the
      slightest reference as to what finally became<br /> of her. Methuselah
      lived nine hundred and sixty-<br /> nine years, and yet, there is not the
      slightest mention<br /> made of Mrs. Methuselah. Enoch was translated,<br />
      and his widow is not mentioned. There is not a<br /> word about Mrs. Seth,
      or Mrs. Enos, or Mrs. Cainan,<br /> or Mrs. Mahalaleel, or Mrs. Jared. We
      do not<br /> know the name of Mrs. Noah, and I believe not the<br /> name of
      a solitary woman is given from the creation<br /> of Eve&mdash;with the
      exception of two of Lamech's<br /> wives&mdash;until Sarai is mentioned as
      being the wife<br /> of Abram.<br /> <br /> If you wish really to know the
      Bible estimation of<br /> woman, turn to the fourth and fifth verses of the<br />
      twelfth chapter of Leviticus, in which a woman, for<br /> the crime of
      having borne a son, is unfit to touch a<br /> hallowed thing, or to come in
      the holy sanctuary for<br /> thirty-three days; but if a woman was the
      mother<br /> of a girl, then she became totally unfit to enter the<br />
      sanctuary, or pollute with her touch a hallowed thing,<br /> <br /> 113<br />
      <br /> for sixty-six days. The pollution was twice as great<br /> when she
      had borne a daughter.<br /> <br /> It is a little difficult to see why it is
      a greater crime<br /> to give birth to a daughter than to a son. Surely, a<br />
      law like that did not tend to the elevation of woman.<br /> You will also
      find in the same chapter that a woman<br /> had to offer a pigeon, or a
      turtle-dove, as a sin offer-<br /> ing, in order to expiate the crime of
      having become a<br /> mother. By the Levitical law, a mother was unclean.<br />
      The priest had to make an atonement for her.<br /> <br /> If there is,
      beneath the stars, a figure of complete<br /> and perfect purity, it is a
      mother holding in her arms<br /> her child. The laws respecting women,
      given by<br /> commandment of Jehovah to the Jews, were born of<br />
      barbarism, and in this day and age should be re-<br /> garded only with
      detestation and contempt. The<br /> twentieth and twenty-first verses of
      the nineteenth<br /> chapter of Leviticus show that the same punishment<br />
      was not meted to men and women guilty of the<br /> same crime.<br /> <br />
      The real explanation of what we find in the Old<br /> Testament degrading
      to woman, lies in the fact, that<br /> the overflow of Love's mysterious
      Nile&mdash;the sacred<br /> source of life&mdash;was, by its savage
      authors, deemed<br /> unclean.<br /> <br /> 114<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      But what have you to say about the<br /> women of the Bible, mentioned by
      Mr. Talmage,<br /> and held up as examples for all time of all that is<br />
      sweet and womanly?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I believe that Esther is his
      principal<br /> heroine. Let us see who she was.<br /> <br /> According to
      the book of Esther, Ahasuerus who<br /> was king of Persia, or some such
      place, ordered<br /> Vashti his queen to show herself to the people<br />
      and the princes, because she was "exceedingly fair<br /> "to look upon."
      For some reason&mdash;modesty per-<br /> haps&mdash;she refused to appear.
      And thereupon the<br /> king "sent letters into all his provinces and to
      every<br /> "people after their language, that every man should<br /> "bear
      rule in his own house;" it being feared that<br /> if it should become
      public that Vashti had disobeyed,<br /> all other wives might follow her
      example. The king<br /> also, for the purpose of impressing upon all women<br />
      the necessity of obeying their husbands, issued a<br /> decree that "Vashti
      should come no more before<br /> "him," and that he would "give her royal
      estate<br /> "unto another." This was done that "all the<br /> "wives should
      give to their husbands honor, both to<br /> "great and small."<br /> <br />
      After this, "the king appointed officers in all the<br /> <br /> 115<br />
      <br /> "provinces of his kingdom that they might gather<br /> "together all
      the fair young virgins," and bring<br /> them to his palace, put them in
      the custody of<br /> his chamberlain, and have them thoroughly washed.<br />
      Then the king was to look over the lot and take<br /> each day the one that
      pleased him best until he found<br /> the one to put in the place of
      Vashti. A fellow by<br /> the name of Mordecai, living in that part of the<br />
      country, hearing of the opportunity to sell a girl,<br /> brought Esther,
      his uncle's daughter,&mdash;she being an<br /> orphan, and very beautiful&mdash;to
      see whether she<br /> might not be the lucky one.<br /> <br /> The remainder
      of the second chapter of this<br /> book, I do not care to repeat. It is
      sufficient to say<br /> that Esther at last was chosen.<br /> <br /> The king
      at this time did not know that Esther<br /> was a Jewess. Mordecai her
      kinsman, however,<br /> discovered a plot to assassinate the king, and
      Esther<br /> told the king, and the two plotting gentlemen were<br /> hanged
      on a tree.<br /> <br /> After a while, a man by the name of Haman was<br />
      made Secretary of State, and everybody coming in<br /> his presence bowed
      except Mordecai. Mordecai was<br /> probably depending on the influence of
      Esther.<br /> Haman finally became so vexed, that he made up<br /> <br /> 116<br />
      <br /> his mind to have all the Jews in the kingdom<br /> destroyed. (The
      number of Jews at that time<br /> in Persia must have been immense.) Haman
      there-<br /> upon requested the king to have an order issued to<br />
      destroy all the Jews, and in consideration of the<br /> order, proposed to
      pay ten thousand talents of silver.<br /> And thereupon, letters were
      written to the governors<br /> of the various provinces, sealed with the
      king's ring,<br /> sent by post in all directions, with instructions to
      kill<br /> all the Jews, both young and old&mdash;little children and<br />
      women,&mdash;in one day. (One would think that the<br /> king copied this
      order from another part of the Old<br /> Testament, or had found an
      original by Jehovah.) The<br /> people immediately made preparations for
      the killing.<br /> Mordecai clothed himself with sack-cloth, and Esther<br />
      called upon one of the king's chamberlains, and she<br /> finally got the
      history of the affair, as well as a copy<br /> of the writing, and
      thereupon made up her mind to<br /> go in and ask the king to save her
      people.<br /> <br /> At that time, Bismarck's idea of government being<br />
      in full force, any one entering the king's presence with-<br /> out an
      invitation, was liable to be put to death. And<br /> in case any one did go
      in to see the king, if the king<br /> failed to hold out his golden
      sceptre, his life was not<br /> spared. Notwithstanding this order, Esther
      put on<br /> <br /> 117<br /> <br /> her best clothes, and stood in the inner
      court of the<br /> king's house, while the king sat on his royal throne.<br />
      When the king saw her standing in the court, he<br /> held out his sceptre,
      and Esther drew near, and he<br /> asked her what she wished; and thereupon
      she<br /> asked that the king and Haman might take dinner<br /> with her
      that day, and it was done. While they were<br /> feasting, the king again
      asked Esther what she<br /> wanted; and her second request was, that they<br />
      would come and dine with her once more. When<br /> Haman left the palace
      that day, he saw Mordecai<br /> again at the gate, standing as stiffly as
      usual, and it<br /> filled Haman with indignation. So Haman, taking<br />
      the advice of his wife, made a gallows fifty cubits<br /> high, for the
      special benefit of Mordecai. The next<br /> day, when Haman went to see the
      king, the king,<br /> having the night before refreshed his memory in<br />
      respect to the service done him by Mordecai, asked<br /> Haman what ought
      to be done for the man whom<br /> the king wished to honor. Haman,
      supposing of<br /> course that the king referred to him, said that royal<br />
      purple ought to be brought forth, such as the king<br /> wore, and the
      horse that the king rode on, and the<br /> crown-royal should be set on the
      man's head;&mdash;that<br /> one of the most noble princes should lead the
      horse,<br /> <br /> 118<br /> <br /> and as he went through the streets,
      proclaim: "Thus<br /> "shall it be done to the man whom the king de-<br />
      "lighteth to honor."<br /> <br /> Thereupon the king told Haman that
      Mordecai<br /> was the man that the king wished to honor. And<br /> Haman
      was forced to lead this horse, backed by<br /> Mordecai, through the
      streets, shouting: "This shall<br /> "be done to the man whom the king
      delighteth to<br /> "honor." Immediately afterward, he went to the<br />
      banquet that Esther had prepared, and the king<br /> again asked Esther her
      petition. She then asked<br /> for the salvation of her people; stating at
      the same<br /> time, that if her people had been sold into slavery,<br />
      she would have held her tongue; but since they<br /> were about to be
      killed, she could not keep silent.<br /> The king asked her who had done
      this thing; and<br /> Esther replied that it was the wicked Haman.<br />
      <br /> Thereupon one of the chamberlains, remembering<br /> the gallows that
      had been made for Mordecai, men-<br /> tioned it, and the king immediately
      ordered that<br /> Haman be hanged thereon; which was done. And<br />
      Mordecai immediately became Secretary of State.<br /> The order against the
      Jews was then rescinded; and<br /> Ahasuerus, willing to do anything that
      Esther de-<br /> sired, hanged all of Haman's folks. He not only did<br />
      <br /> 119<br /> <br /> this, but he immediately issued an order to all the<br />
      Jews allowing them to kill the other folks. And the<br /> Jews got together
      throughout one hundred and<br /> twenty-seven provinces, "and such was
      their power,<br /> "that no man could stand against them; and there-<br />
      "upon the Jews smote all their enemies with the<br /> "stroke of the sword,
      and with slaughter and de-<br /> "struction, and did whatever they pleased
      to those<br /> "who hated them." And in the palace of the king,<br /> the
      Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men, besides<br /> ten sons of Haman;
      and in the rest of the provinces,<br /> they slew seventy-five thousand
      people. And after<br /> this work of slaughter, the Jews had a day of glad-<br />
      ness and feasting.<br /> <br /> One can see from this, what a beautiful
      Bible<br /> character Esther was&mdash;how filled with all that is<br />
      womanly, gentle, kind and tender!<br /> <br /> This story is one of the most
      unreasonable, as well<br /> as one of the most heartless and revengeful, in
      the<br /> whole Bible. Ahasuerus was a monster, and Esther<br /> equally
      infamous; and yet, this woman is held up for<br /> the admiration of
      mankind by a Brooklyn pastor.<br /> There is this peculiarity about the
      book of Esther:<br /> the name of God is not mentioned in it, and the<br />
      deity is not referred to, directly or indirectly;&mdash;yet<br /> <br /> 120<br />
      <br /> it is claimed to be an inspired book. If Jehovah<br /> wrote it, he
      certainly cannot be charged with<br /> egotism.<br /> <br /> I most
      cheerfully admit that the book of Ruth is<br /> quite a pleasant story, and
      the affection of Ruth for<br /> her mother-in-law exceedingly touching, but
      I am of<br /> opinion that Ruth did many things that would be re-<br />
      garded as somewhat indiscreet, even in the city of<br /> Brooklyn.<br />
      <br /> All I can find about Hannah is, that she made a<br /> little coat for
      her boy Samuel, and brought it to him<br /> from year to year. Where he got
      his vest and<br /> pantaloons we are not told. But this fact seems<br />
      hardly enough to make her name immortal.<br /> <br /> So also Mr. Talmage
      refers us to the wonderful<br /> woman Abigail. The story about Abigail,
      told in<br /> plain English, is this: David sent some of his fol-<br />
      lowers to Nabal, Abigail's husband, and demanded<br /> food. Nabal, who
      knew nothing about David, and<br /> cared less, refused. Abigail heard
      about it, and took<br /> food to David and his servants. She was very much<br />
      struck, apparently, with David and David with her.<br /> A few days
      afterward Nabal died&mdash;supposed to have<br /> been killed by the Lord&mdash;but
      probably poisoned;<br /> and thereupon David took Abigail to wife. The<br />
      <br /> 121<br /> <br /> whole matter should have been investigated by the<br />
      grand jury.<br /> <br /> We are also referred to Dorcas, who no doubt was a<br />
      good woman&mdash;made clothes for the poor and gave<br /> alms, as millions
      have done since then. It seems<br /> that this woman died. Peter was sent
      for, and there-<br /> upon raised her from the dead, and she is never men-<br />
      tioned any more. Is it not a little strange that a<br /> woman who had been
      actually raised from the dead,<br /> should have so completely passed out
      of the memory<br /> of her time, that when she died the second time, she<br />
      was entirely unnoticed?<br /> <br /> Is it not astonishing that so little is
      in the New<br /> Testament concerning the mother of Christ? My<br /> own
      opinion is, that she was an excellent woman, and<br /> the wife of Joseph;
      and that Joseph was the actual<br /> father of Christ. I think there can be
      no reasonable<br /> doubt that such was the opinion of the authors of the<br />
      original gospels. Upon any other hypothesis, it is<br /> impossible to
      account for their having given the<br /> genealogy of Joseph to prove that
      Christ was of the<br /> blood of David. The idea that he was the Son of<br />
      God, or in any way miraculously produced, was an<br /> afterthought, and is
      hardly entitled now to serious<br /> consideration. The gospels were
      written so long after<br /> <br /> 122<br /> <br /> the death of Christ, that
      very little was known of him,<br /> and substantially nothing of his
      parents. How is it<br /> that not one word is said about the death of Mary&mdash;<br />
      not one word about the death of Joseph? How did<br /> it happen that Christ
      did not visit his mother after his<br /> resurrection? The first time he
      speaks to his mother<br /> is when he was twelve years old. His mother
      having<br /> told him that she and his father had been seeking<br /> him, he
      replied: "How is it that ye sought me: wist<br /> "ye not that I must be
      about my Father s business?"<br /> <br /> The second time was at the
      marriage feast in Cana,<br /> when he said to her: "Woman, what have I to
      do<br /> "with thee?" And the third time was at the cross,<br /> when
      "Jesus, seeing his mother standing by the<br /> "disciple whom he loved,
      said to her: Woman, be-<br /> "hold thy son;" and to the disciple: "Behold
      thy<br /> "mother." And this is all.<br /> <br /> The best thing about the
      Catholic Church is<br /> the deification of Mary,&mdash;and yet this is
      denounced<br /> by Protestantism as idolatry. There is something<br /> in
      the human heart that prompts man to tell his faults<br /> more freely to
      the mother than to the father. The<br /> cruelty of Jehovah is softened by
      the mercy of<br /> Mary.<br /> <br /> Is it not strange that none of the
      disciples of Christ<br /> <br /> 123<br /> <br /> said anything about their
      parents,&mdash;that we know<br /> absolutely nothing of them? Is there any
      evidence<br /> that they showed any particular respect even for the<br />
      mother of Christ?<br /> <br /> Mary Magdalen is, in many respects, the
      tenderest<br /> and most loving character in the New Testament.<br />
      According to the account, her love for Christ knew<br /> no abatement,&mdash;no
      change&mdash;true even in the hopeless<br /> shadow of the cross. Neither
      did it die with his<br /> death. She waited at the sepulchre; she hasted in<br />
      the early morning to his tomb, and yet the only<br /> comfort Christ gave
      to this true and loving soul lies<br /> in these strangely cold and
      heartless words: "Touch<br /> "me not."<br /> <br /> There is nothing tending
      to show that the women<br /> spoken of in the Bible were superior to the
      ones we<br /> know. There are to-day millions of women making<br /> coats
      for their sons,&mdash;hundreds of thousands of<br /> women, true not simply
      to innocent people, falsely<br /> accused, but to criminals. Many a loving
      heart is<br /> as true to the gallows as Mary was to the cross.<br /> There
      are hundreds of thousands of women accept-<br /> ing poverty and want and
      dishonor, for the love they<br /> bear unworthy men; hundreds and
      thousands, hun-<br /> dreds and thousands, working day and night, with<br />
      <br /> 124<br /> <br /> strained eyes and tired hands, for husbands and<br />
      children,&mdash;clothed in rags, housed in huts and hovels,<br /> hoping
      day after day for the angel of death. There are<br /> thousands of women in
      Christian England, working in<br /> iron, laboring in the fields and
      toiling in mines. There<br /> are hundreds and thousands in Europe,
      everywhere,<br /> doing the work of men&mdash;deformed by toil, and who<br />
      would become simply wild and ferocious beasts,<br /> except for the love
      they bear for home and child.<br /> <br /> You need not go back four
      thousand years for<br /> heroines. The world is filled with them to-day.<br />
      They do not belong to any nation, nor to any religion,<br /> nor
      exclusively to any race. Wherever woman is<br /> found, they are found.<br />
      <br /> There is no description of any women in the Bible<br /> that equal
      thousands and thousands of women known<br /> to-day. The women mentioned by
      Mr. Talmage fall<br /> almost infinitely below, not simply those in real
      life, but<br /> the creations of the imagination found in the world of<br />
      fiction. They will not compare with the women born<br /> of Shakespeare's
      brain. You will find none like<br /> Isabella, in whose spotless life, love
      and reason<br /> blended into perfect truth; nor Juliet, within whose<br />
      heart passion and purity met, like white and red within<br /> the bosom of
      a rose; nor Cordelia, who chose to<br /> <br /> 125<br /> <br /> suffer loss
      rather than show her wealth of love with<br /> those who gilded dross with
      golden words in hope<br /> of gain; nor Miranda, who told her love as
      freely<br /> as a flower gives its bosom to the kisses of the sun;<br /> nor
      Imogene, who asked: "What is it to be false?"<br /> nor Hermione, who bore
      with perfect faith and hope<br /> the cross of shame, and who at last
      forgave with all<br /> her heart; nor Desdemona, her innocence so perfect<br />
      and her love so pure, that she was incapable of sus-<br /> pecting that
      another could suspect, and sought with<br /> dying words to hide her
      lover's crime.<br /> <br /> If we wish to find what the Bible thinks of<br />
      woman, all that is necessary to do is to read it.<br /> We will find that
      everywhere she is spoken of<br /> simply as property,&mdash;as belonging
      absolutely to the<br /> man. We will find that whenever a man got tired<br />
      of his wife, all he had to do was to give her a writing<br /> of
      divorcement, and that then the mother of his<br /> children became a
      houseless and a homeless wanderer.<br /> We will find that men were allowed
      to have as<br /> many wives as they could get, either by courtship,<br />
      purchase, or conquest. The Jewish people in the<br /> olden time were in
      many respects like their barbarian<br /> neighbors.<br /> <br /> If we read
      the New Testament, we will find in the<br /> <br /> 126<br /> <br /> epistle
      of Paul to Timothy, the following gallant<br /> passages:<br /> <br /> "Let
      the woman learn in silence, with all<br /> "subjection."<br /> <br /> "But I
      suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp<br /> "authority over the man,
      but to be in silence."<br /> <br /> And for these kind, gentle and civilized
      remarks,<br /> the apostle Paul gives the following reasons:<br /> <br />
      "For Adam was first formed, then Eve."<br /> <br /> "And Adam was not
      deceived, but the woman<br /> "being deceived was in the transgression."<br />
      <br /> Certainly women ought to feel under great obli-<br /> gation to the
      apostle Paul.<br /> <br /> In the fifth chapter of the same epistle, Paul,<br />
      advising Timothy as to what kind of people he<br /> should admit into his
      society or church, uses the<br /> following language:<br /> <br /> "Let not a
      widow be taken into the number under<br /> "threescore years old, having
      been the wife of one<br /> "man."<br /> <br /> "But the younger widows
      refuse, for when they<br /> "have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they
      will<br /> "marry."<br /> <br /> This same Paul did not seem to think
      polygamy<br /> wrong, except in a bishop. He tells Timothy that:<br /> <br />
      127<br /> <br /> "A bishop must be blameless, the husband of one<br />
      "wife."<br /> <br /> He also lays down the rule that a deacon should be<br />
      the husband of one wife, leaving us to infer that the<br /> other members
      might have as many as they could get.<br /> <br /> In the second epistle to
      Timothy, Paul speaks of<br /> "grandmother Lois," who was referred to in
      such<br /> extravagant language by Mr. Talmage, and nothing<br /> is said
      touching her character in the least. All her<br /> virtues live in the
      imagination, and in the imagina-<br /> tion alone.<br /> <br /> Paul, also,
      in his epistle to the Ephesians, says:<br /> <br /> "Wives, submit
      yourselves unto your own hus-<br /> "bands, as unto the Lord. For the
      husband is the<br /> "head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the<br />
      "church."<br /> <br /> "Therefore, as the church is subject unto Christ,<br />
      "so let the wives be to their own husbands, in<br /> "everything."<br />
      <br /> You will find, too, that in the seventh chapter of<br /> First
      Corinthians, Paul laments that all men are not<br /> bachelors like
      himself, and in the second verse of<br /> that chapter he gives the only
      reason for which he<br /> was willing that men and women should marry. He<br />
      advised all the unmarried, and all widows, to remain<br /> <br /> 128<br />
      <br /> as he was. In the ninth verse of this same chapter<br /> is a slander
      too vulgar for repetition,&mdash;an estimate<br /> of woman and of woman's
      love so low and vile, that<br /> every woman should hold the inspired
      author in<br /> infinite abhorrence.<br /> <br /> Paul sums up the whole
      matter, however, by telling<br /> those who have wives or husbands, to stay
      with<br /> them&mdash;as necessary evils only to be tolerated&mdash;but<br />
      sincerely regrets that anybody was ever married;<br /> and finally says
      that:<br /> <br /> "They that have wives should be as though they<br /> "had
      none;" because, in his opinion:<br /> <br /> "He that is unmarried careth
      for the things that<br /> "belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord;<br />
      "but he that is married careth for the things that are<br /> "of the world,
      how he may please his wife."<br /> <br /> "There is this difference also,"
      he tells us, "be-<br /> "tween a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman<br />
      "careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be<br /> "holy both in
      body and in spirit; but she that is<br /> "married careth for the things of
      the world, how she<br /> " may please her husband."<br /> <br /> Of course,
      it is contended that these things have<br /> tended to the elevation of
      woman.<br /> <br /> The idea that it is better to love the Lord than to<br />
      <br /> 129<br /> <br /> love your wife, or your husband, is infinitely
      absurd.<br /> Nobody ever did love the Lord,&mdash;nobody can&mdash;until<br />
      he becomes acquainted with him.<br /> <br /> Saint Paul also tells us that
      "Man is the image<br /> "and glory of God; but woman is the glory of<br />
      "man;" and for the purpose of sustaining this posi-<br /> tion, says:<br />
      <br /> "For the man is not of the woman, but the woman<br /> "of the man;
      neither was the man created for the<br /> "woman, but the woman for the
      man."<br /> <br /> Of course, we can all see that man could have<br /> gotten
      along well enough without woman, but woman,<br /> by no possibility, could
      have gotten along without<br /> man. And yet, this is called "inspired;"
      and this<br /> apostle Paul is supposed to have known more than<br /> all
      the people now upon the earth. No wonder Paul<br /> at last was constrained
      to say: "We are fools for<br /> "Christ's sake."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      How do you account for the present<br /> condition of woman in what is
      known as "the civilized<br /> "world," unless the Bible has bettered her
      condition?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. We must remember that thousands of<br />
      things enter into the problem of civilization. Soil,<br /> climate, and
      geographical position, united with count-<br /> <br /> 130<br /> <br /> less
      other influences, have resulted in the civilization<br /> of our time. If
      we want to find what the influence of<br /> the Bible has been, we must
      ascertain the condition<br /> of Europe when the Bible was considered as
      abso-<br /> lutely true, and when it wielded its greatest influence.<br />
      <br /> Christianity as a form of religion had actual posses-<br /> sion of
      Europe during the Middle Ages. At that<br /> time, it exerted its greatest
      power. Then it had the<br /> opportunity of breaking the shackles from the
      limbs<br /> of woman. Christianity found the Roman matron a<br /> free
      woman. Polygamy was never known in Rome;<br /> and although divorces were
      allowed by law, the<br /> Roman state had been founded for more than five<br />
      hundred years before either a husband or a wife<br /> asked for a divorce.
      From the foundation of Chris-<br /> tianity,&mdash;I mean from the time it
      became the force in<br /> the Roman state,&mdash;woman, as such, went down
      in<br /> the scale of civilization. The sceptre was taken from<br /> her
      hands, and she became once more the slave and<br /> serf of man. The men
      also were made slaves, and<br /> woman has regained her liberty by the same
      means<br /> that man has regained his,&mdash;by wresting authority<br />
      from the hands of the church. While the church had<br /> power, the wife
      and mother was not considered as<br /> good as the begging nun; the husband
      and father<br /> was far below the vermin-covered monk; homes<br /> were of
      no value compared with the cathedral; for<br /> God had to have a house, no
      matter how many of<br /> his children were wanderers. During all the years
      in<br /> which woman has struggled for equal liberty with<br /> man, she has
      been met with the Bible doctrine that<br /> she is the inferior of the man;
      that Adam was made<br /> first, and Eve afterwards; that man was not made
      for<br /> woman, but that woman was made for man.<br /> <br /> I find that in
      this day and generation, the meanest<br /> men have the lowest estimate of
      woman; that the<br /> greater the man is, the grander he is, the more he<br />
      thinks of mother, wife and daughter. I also find that<br /> just in the
      proportion that he has lost confidence in the<br /> polygamy of Jehovah and
      in the advice and philosophy<br /> of Saint Paul, he believes in the rights
      and liberties of<br /> woman. As a matter of fact, men have risen from a<br />
      perusal of the Bible, and murdered their wives. They<br /> have risen from
      reading its pages, and inflicted cruel<br /> and even mortal blows upon
      their children. Men<br /> have risen from reading the Bible and torn the
      flesh<br /> of others with red-hot pincers. They have laid<br /> down the
      sacred volume long enough to pour molten<br /> lead into the ears of
      others. They have stopped<br /> reading the sacred Scriptures for a
      sufficient time to<br /> <br /> 132<br /> <br /> incarcerate their fellow-men,
      to load them with chains,<br /> and then they have gone back to their
      reading,<br /> allowing their victims to die in darkness and despair.<br />
      Men have stopped reading the Old Testament long<br /> enough to drive a
      stake into the ground and collect a<br /> few fagots and burn an honest
      man. Even ministers<br /> have denied themselves the privilege of reading
      the<br /> sacred book long enough to tell falsehoods about<br /> their
      fellow-men. There is no crime that Bible<br /> readers and Bible believers
      and Bible worshipers and<br /> Bible defenders have not committed. There is
      no<br /> meanness of which some Bible reader, believer, and<br /> defender,
      has not been guilty. Bible believers and<br /> Bible defenders have filled
      the world with calumnies<br /> and slanders. Bible believers and Bible
      defenders<br /> have not only whipped their wives, but they have<br />
      murdered them; they have murdered their children.<br /> I do not say that
      reading the Bible will necessarily<br /> make men dishonest, but I do say,
      that reading the<br /> Bible will not prevent their committing crimes. I do<br />
      not say that believing the Bible will necessarily make<br /> men commit
      burglary, but I do say that a belief in the<br /> Bible has caused men to
      persecute each other, to<br /> imprison each other, and to burn each other.<br />
      <br /> Only a little while ago, a British clergyman mur-<br /> <br /> 133<br />
      <br /> dered his wife. Only a little while ago, an American<br /> Protestant
      clergyman whipped his boy to death be-<br /> cause the boy refused to say a
      prayer.<br /> <br /> The Rev. Mr. Crowley not only believed the Bible,<br />
      but was licensed to expound it. He had been<br /> "called" to the ministry,
      and upon his head had<br /> been laid the holy hands; and yet, he
      deliberately<br /> starved orphans, and while looking upon their<br />
      sunken eyes and hollow cheeks, sung pious hymns<br /> and quoted with great
      unction: "Suffer little chil-<br /> "dren to come unto me."<br /> <br /> As a
      matter of fact, in the last twenty years,<br /> more money has been stolen
      by Christian cashiers,<br /> Christian presidents, Christian directors,
      Christian<br /> trustees and Christian statesmen, than by all other<br />
      convicts in all the penitentiaries in all the Christian<br /> world.<br />
      <br /> The assassin of Henry the Fourth was a Bible reader<br /> and a Bible
      believer. The instigators of the massacre<br /> of St. Bartholomew were
      believers in your sacred<br /> Scriptures. The men who invested their money
      in the<br /> slave-trade believed themselves filled with the Holy<br />
      Ghost, and read with rapture the Psalms of David and<br /> the Sermon on
      the Mount. The murderers of Scotch<br /> Presbyterians were believers in
      Revelation, and the<br /> <br /> 134<br /> Presbyterians, when they murdered
      others, were also<br /> believers. Nearly every man who expiates a crime<br />
      upon the gallows is a believer in the Bible. For a<br /> thousand years,
      the daggers of assassination and the<br /> swords of war were blest by
      priests&mdash;by the believers<br /> in the sacred Scriptures. The assassin
      of President<br /> Garfield is a believer in the Bible, a hater of
      infidelity,<br /> a believer in personal inspiration, and he expects in a<br />
      few weeks to join the winged and redeemed in<br /> heaven.<br /> <br /> If a
      man would follow, to-day, the teachings of the<br /> Old Testament, he
      would be a criminal. If he would<br /> follow strictly the teachings of the
      New, he would be<br /> insane.<br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="link0006"

      <br /> <br /> <i>Son. There is no devil.<br /> <br /> Mother. I know there is.<br />
      <br /> Son. How do you know?<br /> <br /> Mother. Because they make pictures
      that look just<br /> like him.<br /> <br /> Son. But, mother&mdash;<br />
      <br /> Mother. Don't "mother" me! You are trying to<br /> disgrace your
      parents.</i><br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. I want to ask you a few questions
      about<br /> Mr. Talmage's fourth sermon against you, entitled:<br /> "The
      Meanness of Infidelity," in which he compares<br /> you to Jehoiakim, who
      had the temerity to throw<br /> some of the writings of the weeping
      Jeremiah into<br /> the fire?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. So far as I am
      concerned, I really re-<br /> gret that a second edition of Jeremiah's roll
      was<br /> gotten out. It would have been far better for us all,<br /> if it
      had been left in ashes. There was nothing but<br /> curses and prophecies
      of evil, in the sacred roll that<br /> <br /> 138<br /> <br /> Jehoiakim
      burned. The Bible tells us that Jehovah<br /> became exceedingly wroth
      because of the destruction<br /> of this roll, and pronounced a curse upon
      Jehoiakim<br /> and upon Palestine. I presume it was on account of<br /> the
      burning of that roll that the king of Babylon<br /> destroyed the chosen
      people of God. It was on<br /> account of that sacrilege that the Lord said
      of<br /> Jehoiakim: "He shall have none to sit upon the<br /> "throne of
      David; and his dead body shall be cast<br /> "out in the day to the heat,
      and in the night to the<br /> "frost." Any one can see how much a dead body<br />
      would suffer under such circumstances. Imagine an<br /> infinitely wise,
      good and powerful God taking ven-<br /> geance on the corpse of a barbarian
      king! What<br /> joy there must have been in heaven as the angels<br />
      watched the alternate melting and freezing of the<br /> dead body of
      Jehoiakim!<br /> <br /> Jeremiah was probably the most accomplished<br />
      croaker of all time. Nothing satisfied him. He was<br /> a prophetic
      pessimist,&mdash;an ancient Bourbon. He<br /> was only happy when
      predicting war, pestilence and<br /> famine. No wonder Jehoiakim despised
      him, and<br /> hated all he wrote.<br /> <br /> One can easily see the
      character of Jeremiah from<br /> the following occurrence: When the
      Babylonians<br /> <br /> 139<br /> <br /> had succeeded in taking Jerusalem,
      and in sacking<br /> the city, Jeremiah was unfortunately taken prisoner;<br />
      but Captain Nebuzaradan came to Jeremiah, and told<br /> him that he would
      let him go, because he had pro-<br /> phesied against his own country. He
      was regarded<br /> as a friend by the enemy.<br /> <br /> There was, at that
      time, as now, the old fight<br /> between the church and the civil power.
      Whenever<br /> a king failed to do what the priests wanted, they<br />
      immediately prophesied overthrow, disaster, and de-<br /> feat. Whenever
      the kings would hearken to their<br /> voice, and would see to it that the
      priests had plenty<br /> to eat and drink and wear, then they all declared<br />
      that Jehovah would love that king, would let him live<br /> out all his
      days, and allow his son to reign in his<br /> stead. It was simply the old
      conflict that is still being<br /> waged, and it will be carried on until
      universal civil-<br /> ization does away with priestcraft and superstition.<br />
      <br /> The priests in the days of Jeremiah were the same<br /> as now. They
      sought to rule the State. They pre-<br /> tended that, at their request,
      Jehovah would withhold<br /> or send the rain; that the seasons were within
      their<br /> power; that they with bitter words could blight the<br /> fields
      and curse the land with want and death. They<br /> gloried then, as now, in
      the exhibition of God's wrath.<br /> <br /> 140<br /> <br /> In prosperity,
      the priests were forgotten. Success<br /> scorned them; Famine flattered
      them; Health laughed<br /> at them; Pestilence prayed to them; Disaster was<br />
      their only friend.<br /> <br /> These old prophets prophesied nothing but
      evil,<br /> and consequently, when anything bad happened, they<br /> claimed
      it as a fulfillment, and pointed with pride to<br /> the fact that they
      had, weeks or months, or years<br /> before, foretold something of that
      kind. They were<br /> really the originators of the phrase, "I told you
      so!"<br /> <br /> There was a good old Methodist class-leader that<br />
      lived down near a place called Liverpool, on the<br /> Illinois river. In
      the spring of 1861 the old man,<br /> telling his experience, among other
      things said, that he<br /> had lived there by the river for more than
      thirty<br /> years, and he did not believe that a year had passed<br /> that
      there were not hundreds of people during the<br /> hunting season shooting
      ducks on Sunday; that he<br /> had told his wife thousands of times that no
      good<br /> would come of it; that evil would come of it; "And<br /> "now,
      said the old man, raising his voice with the<br /> importance of the
      announcement, "war is upon us!"<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you wish,
      as Mr. Talmage says, to de-<br /> stroy the Bible&mdash;to have all the
      copies burned to ashes?<br /> What do you wish to have done with the Bible?<br />
      <br /> 141<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I want the Bible treated exactly as we<br />
      treat other books&mdash;preserve the good and throw<br /> away the foolish
      and the hurtful. I am fighting the<br /> doctrine of inspiration. As long
      as it is believed that<br /> the Bible is inspired, that book is the master&mdash;no<br />
      mind is free. With that belief, intellectual liberty is<br /> impossible.
      With that belief, you can investigate<br /> only at the risk of losing your
      soul. The Catholics<br /> have a pope. Protestants laugh at them, and yet
      the<br /> pope is capable of intellectual advancement. In<br /> addition to
      this, the pope is mortal, and the church<br /> cannot be afflicted with the
      same idiot forever. The<br /> Protestants have a book for their pope. The
      book<br /> cannot advance. Year after year, and century after<br /> century,
      the book remains as ignorant as ever. It is<br /> only made better by those
      who believe in its inspira-<br /> tion giving better meanings to the words
      than their<br /> ancestors did. In this way it may be said that the<br />
      Bible grows a little better.<br /> <br /> Why should we have a book for a
      master? That<br /> which otherwise might be a blessing, remains a curse.<br />
      If every copy of the Bible were destroyed, all that is<br /> good in that
      book would be reproduced in a single<br /> day. Leave every copy of the
      Bible as it is, and<br /> have every human being believe in its
      inspiration,<br /> <br /> 142<br /> <br /> and intellectual liberty would
      cease to exist. The<br /> whole race, from that moment, would go back to-<br />
      ward the night of intellectual death.<br /> <br /> The Bible would do more
      harm if more people<br /> really believed it, and acted in accordance with
      its<br /> teachings. Now and then a Freeman puts the knife<br /> to the
      heart of his child. Now and then an assassin<br /> relies upon some sacred
      passage; but, as a rule, few<br /> men believe the Bible to be absolutely
      true.<br /> <br /> There are about fifteen hundred million people in<br />
      the world. There are not two million who have read<br /> the Bible through.
      There are not two hundred<br /> million who ever saw the Bible. There are
      not five<br /> hundred million who ever heard that such a book<br /> exists.<br />
      <br /> Christianity is claimed to be a religion for all<br /> mankind. It
      was founded more than eighteen cen-<br /> turies ago; and yet, not one
      human being in three<br /> has ever heard of it. As a matter of fact, for
      more<br /> than fourteen centuries and-a-half after the crucifixion<br /> of
      Christ, this hemisphere was absolutely unknown.<br /> There was not a
      Christian in the world who knew<br /> there was such a continent as ours,
      and all the<br /> inhabitants of this, the New World, were deprived<br /> of
      the gospel for fourteen centuries and-a-half, and<br /> <br /> 143<br />
      <br /> knew nothing of its blessings until they were in-<br /> formed by
      Spanish murderers and marauders. Even<br /> in the United States,
      Christianity is not keeping pace<br /> with the increase of population.
      When we take<br /> into consideration that it is aided by the momentum<br />
      of eighteen centuries, is it not wonderful that it is not<br /> to-day
      holding its own? The reason of this is, that<br /> we are beginning to
      understand the Scriptures. We<br /> are beginningto see, and to see
      clearly, that they are<br /> simply of human origin, and that the Bible
      bears<br /> the marks of the barbarians who wrote it. The best<br />
      educated among the clergy admit that we know but<br /> little as to the
      origin of the gospels; that we do not<br /> positively know the author of
      one of them; that it is<br /> really a matter of doubt as to who wrote the
      five<br /> books attributed to Moses. They admit now, that<br /> Isaiah was
      written by more than one person; that<br /> Solomon's Song was not written
      by that king; that<br /> Job is, in all probability, not a Jewish book;
      that<br /> Ecclesiastes must have been written by a Freethinker,<br /> and
      by one who had his doubts about the immortality<br /> of the soul. The best
      biblical students of the so-<br /> called orthodox world now admit that
      several stories<br /> were united to make the gospel of Saint Luke; that<br />
      Hebrews is a selection from many fragments, and<br /> <br /> 144<br /> <br />
      that no human being, not afflicted with delirium<br /> tremens, can
      understand the book of Revelation.<br /> <br /> I am not the only one
      engaged in the work of<br /> destruction. Every Protestant who expresses a
      doubt<br /> as to the genuineness of a passage, is destroying the<br />
      Bible. The gentlemen who have endeavored to treat<br /> hell as a question
      of syntax, and to prove that eternal<br /> punishment depends upon grammar,
      are helping to<br /> bring the Scriptures into contempt. Hundreds of<br />
      years ago, the Catholics told the Protestant world that<br /> it was
      dangerous to give the Bible to the people.<br /> The Catholics were right;
      the Protestants were<br /> wrong. To read is to think. To think is to
      investi-<br /> gate. To investigate is, finally, to deny. That book<br />
      should have been read only by priests. Every copy<br /> should have been
      under the lock and key of bishop,<br /> cardinal and pope. The common
      people should have<br /> received the Bible from the lips of the ministers.<br />
      The world should have been kept in ignorance. In<br /> that way, and in
      that way only, could the pulpit have<br /> maintained its power. He who
      teaches a child<br /> the alphabet sows the seeds of heresy. I have lived<br />
      to see the schoolhouse in many a village larger than<br /> the church.
      Every man who finds a fact, is the<br /> enemy of theology. Every man who
      expresses an<br /> <br /> 145<br /> <br /> honest thought is a soldier in the
      army of intellectual<br /> liberty.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage
      thinks that you laugh too<br /> much,&mdash;that you exhibit too much
      mirth, and that no<br /> one should smile at sacred things?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      The church has always feared ridicule.<br /> The minister despises
      laughter. He who builds upon<br /> ignorance and awe, fears intelligence
      and mirth. The<br /> theologians always begin by saying: "Let us be<br />
      "solemn." They know that credulity and awe are<br /> twins. They also know
      that while Reason is the<br /> pilot of the soul, Humor carries the lamp.
      Whoever<br /> has the sense of humor fully developed, cannot, by<br /> any
      possibility, be an orthodox theologian. He would<br /> be his own laughing
      stock. The most absurd stories,<br /> the most laughable miracles, read in
      a solemn, stately<br /> way, sound to the ears of ignorance and awe like<br />
      truth. It has been the object of the church for<br /> eighteen hundred
      years to prevent laughter.<br /> <br /> A smile is the dawn of a doubt.<br />
      <br /> Ministers are always talking about death, and<br /> coffins, and
      dust, and worms,&mdash;the cross in this life,<br /> and the fires of
      another. They have been the<br /> enemies of human happiness. They hate to
      hear<br /> <br /> 146<br /> <br /> even the laughter of children. There seems
      to have<br /> been a bond of sympathy between divinity and<br /> dyspepsia,
      between theology and indigestion. There<br /> is a certain pious hatred of
      pleasure, and those who<br /> have been "born again" are expected to
      despise<br /> "the transitory joys of this fleeting life." In this,<br />
      they follow the example of their prophets, of whom<br /> they proudly say:
      "They never smiled."<br /> <br /> Whoever laughs at a holy falsehood, is
      called a<br /> "scoffer." Whoever gives vent to his natural feel-<br /> ings
      is regarded as a "blasphemer," and whoever<br /> examines the Bible as he
      examines other books, and<br /> relies upon his reason to interpret it, is
      denounced<br /> as a "reprobate."<br /> <br /> Let us respect the truth, let
      us laugh at miracles,<br /> and above all, let us be candid with each
      other.<br /> <br /> 'Question. Mr. Talmage charges that you have, in<br />
      your lectures, satirized your early home; that you<br /> have described
      with bitterness the Sundays that were<br /> forced upon you in your youth;
      and that in various<br /> ways you have denounced your father as a
      "tyrant,"<br /> or a "bigot," or a "fool"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I have
      described the manner in which<br /> Sunday was kept when I was a boy. My
      father for<br /> <br /> 147<br /> <br /> many years regarded the Sabbath as a
      sacred day.<br /> We kept Sunday as most other Christians did. I think<br />
      that my father made a mistake about that day. I<br /> have no doubt he was
      honest about it, and really<br /> believed that it was pleasing to God for
      him to keep<br /> the Sabbath as he did.<br /> <br /> I think that Sunday
      should not be a day of gloom,<br /> of silence and despair, or a day in
      which to hear that<br /> the chances are largely in favor of your being
      eternally<br /> damned. That day, in my opinion, should be one of<br /> joy;
      a day to get acquainted with your wife and<br /> children; a day to visit
      the woods, or the sea, or the<br /> murmuring stream; a day to gather
      flowers, to visit<br /> the graves of your dead, to read old poems, old<br />
      letters, old books; a day to rekindle the fires of<br /> friendship and
      love.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage says that my father was a Christian,<br /> and
      he then proceeds to malign his memory. It<br /> seems to me that a living
      Christian should at least<br /> tell the truth about one who sleeps the
      silent sleep<br /> of death.<br /> <br /> I have said nothing, in any of my
      lectures, about<br /> my father, or about my mother, or about any of my<br />
      relatives. I have not the egotism to bring them<br /> forward. They have
      nothing to do with the subject<br /> <br /> 148<br /> <br /> in hand. That my
      father was mistaken upon the<br /> subject of religion, I have no doubt. He
      was a good,<br /> a brave and honest man. I loved him living, and<br /> I
      love him dead. I never said to him an unkind<br /> word, and in my heart
      there never was of him an<br /> unkind thought. He was grand enough to say
      to<br /> me, that I had the same right to my opinion that he<br /> had to
      his. He was great enough to tell me to read<br /> the Bible for myself, to
      be honest with myself, and if<br /> after reading it I concluded it was not
      the word of<br /> God, that it was my duty to say so.<br /> <br /> My mother
      died when I was but a child; and from<br /> that day&mdash;the darkest of
      my life&mdash;her memory has<br /> been within my heart a sacred thing, and
      I have felt,<br /> through all these years, her kisses on my lips.<br />
      <br /> I know that my parents&mdash;if they are conscious now<br /> &mdash;do
      not wish me to honor them at the expense of<br /> my manhood. I know that
      neither my father nor my<br /> mother would have me sacrifice upon their
      graves my<br /> honest thought. I know that I can only please them by<br />
      being true to myself, by defending what I believe is<br /> good, by
      attacking what I believe is bad. Yet this min-<br /> ister of Christ is
      cruel enough, and malicious enough,<br /> to attack the reputation of the
      dead. What he says<br /> about my father is utterly and unqualifiedly
      false.<br /> <br /> 149<br /> <br /> Right here, it may be well enough for me
      to say,<br /> that long before my father died, he threw aside, as<br />
      unworthy of a place in the mind of an intelligent<br /> man, the infamous
      dogma of eternal fire; that he<br /> regarded with abhorrence many passages
      in the Old<br /> Testament; that he believed man, in another world,<br />
      would have the eternal opportunity of doing right,<br /> and that the pity
      of God would last as long as the<br /> suffering of man. My father and my
      mother were<br /> good, in spite of the Old Testament. They were mer-<br />
      ciful, in spite of the one frightful doctrine in the New.<br /> They did
      not need the religion of Presbyterianism.<br /> Presbyterianism never made
      a human being better.<br /> If there is anything that will freeze the
      generous<br /> current of the soul, it is Calvinism. If there is any<br />
      creed that will destroy charity, that will keep the<br /> tears of pity
      from the cheeks of men and women, it<br /> is Presbyterianism. If there is
      any doctrine calcu-<br /> lated to make man bigoted, unsympathetic, and<br />
      cruel, it is the doctrine of predestination. Neither<br /> my father, nor
      my mother, believed in the damnation<br /> of babes, nor in the inspiration
      of John Calvin.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage professes to be a Christian. What<br />
      effect has the religion of Jesus Christ had upon him?<br /> Is he the
      product&mdash;the natural product&mdash;of Chris-<br /> <br /> 150<br />
      <br /> tianity? Does the real Christian violate the sanctity<br /> of death?
      Does the real Christian malign the<br /> memory of the dead? Does the good
      Christian<br /> defame unanswering and unresisting dust?<br /> <br /> But why
      should I expect kindness from a Chris-<br /> tian? Can a minister be
      expected to treat with<br /> fairness a man whom his God intends to damn?
      If<br /> a good God is going to burn an infidel forever, in<br /> the world
      to come, surely a Christian should have<br /> the right to persecute him a
      little here.<br /> <br /> What right has a Christian to ask anybody to love<br />
      his father, or mother, or wife, or child? According<br /> to the gospels,
      Christ offered a reward to any one<br /> who would desert his father or his
      mother. He<br /> offered a premium to gentlemen for leaving their<br />
      wives, and tried to bribe people to abandon their<br /> little children. He
      offered them happiness in this<br /> world, and a hundred fold in the next,
      if they would<br /> turn a deaf ear to the supplications of a father, the<br />
      beseeching cry of a wife, and would leave the out-<br /> stretched arms of
      babes. They were not even<br /> allowed to bury their fathers and their
      mothers. At<br /> that time they were expected to prefer Jesus to their<br />
      wives and children. And now an orthodox minister<br /> says that a man
      ought not to express his honest<br /> <br /> 151<br /> <br /> thoughts,
      because they do not happen to be in accord<br /> with the belief of his
      father or mother.<br /> <br /> Suppose Mr. Talmage should read the Bible
      care-<br /> fully and without fear, and should come to the honest<br />
      conclusion that it is not inspired, what course would<br /> he pursue for
      the purpose of honoring his parents?<br /> Would he say, "I cannot tell the
      truth, I must lie,<br /> "for the purpose of shedding a halo of glory
      around<br /> "the memory of my mother"? Would he say: "Of<br /> "course, my
      father and mother would a thousand<br /> "times rather have their son a
      hypocritical Christian<br /> "than an honest, manly unbeliever"? This might<br />
      please Mr. Talmage, and accord perfectly with his<br /> view, but I prefer
      to say, that my father wished me to<br /> be an honest man. If he is in
      "heaven" now, I am<br /> sure that he would rather hear me attack the<br />
      "inspired" word of God, honestly and bravely, than<br /> to hear me, in the
      solemn accents of hypocrisy, defend<br /> what I believe to be untrue.<br />
      <br /> I may be mistaken in the estimate angels put upon<br /> human beings.
      It may be that God likes a pretended<br /> follower better than an honest,
      outspoken man&mdash;one<br /> who is an infidel simply because he does not
      under-<br /> stand this God. But it seems to me, in my unregenerate<br />
      condition, touched and tainted as I am by original sin,<br /> <br /> 152<br />
      <br /> that a God of infinite power and wisdom ought to be<br /> able to
      make a man brave enough to have an opinion<br /> of his own. I cannot
      conceive of God taking any<br /> particular pride in any hypocrite he has
      ever made.<br /> Whatever he may say through his ministers, or<br />
      whatever the angels may repeat, a manly devil<br /> stands higher in my
      estimation than an unmanly<br /> angel. I do not mean by this, that there
      are any<br /> unmanly angels, neither do I pretend that there<br /> are any
      manly devils. My meaning is this: If I have<br /> a Creator, I can only
      honor him by being true to<br /> myself, and kind and just to my
      fellow-men. If I wish<br /> to shed lustre upon my father and mother, I can<br />
      only do so by being absolutely true to myself.<br /> Never will I lay the
      wreath of hypocrisy upon the<br /> tombs of those I love.<br /> <br /> Mr.
      Talmage takes the ground that we must defend<br /> the religious belief of
      our parents. He seems to<br /> forget that all parents do not believe
      exactly alike,<br /> and that everybody has at least two parents. Now,<br />
      suppose that the father is an infidel, and the mother<br /> a Christian,
      what must the son do? Must he "drive<br /> "the ploughshare of contempt
      through the grave of<br /> "the father," for the purpose of honoring the
      mother;<br /> or must he drive the ploughshare through the grave<br /> <br />
      153<br /> <br /> of the mother to honor the father; or must he com-<br />
      promise, and talk one way and believe another? If<br /> Mr. Talmage's
      doctrine is correct, only persons who<br /> have no knowledge of their
      parents can have liberty<br /> of opinion. Foundlings would be the only
      free<br /> people. I do not suppose that Mr. Talmage would<br /> go so far
      as to say that a child would be bound by<br /> the religion of the person
      upon whose door-steps he<br /> was found. If he does not, then over every
      foundling<br /> hospital should be these words: "Home of Intel-<br />
      "lectual Liberty."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you suppose that we will
      care<br /> nothing in the next world for those we loved in this?<br /> Is it
      worse in a man than in an angel, to care nothing<br /> for his mother?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. According to Mr. Talmage, a man can<br /> be perfectly
      happy in heaven, with his mother in hell.<br /> He will be so entranced
      with the society of Christ,<br /> that he will not even inquire what has
      become of his<br /> wife. The Holy Ghost will keep him in such a state<br />
      of happy wonder, of ecstatic joy, that the names,<br /> even, of his
      children will never invade his memory.<br /> It may be that I am lacking in
      filial affection, but<br /> I would much rather be in hell, with my parents<br />
      <br /> 154<br /> <br /> in heaven, than be in heaven with my parents in hell.<br />
      I think a thousand times more of my parents than I<br /> do of Christ. They
      knew me, they worked for me,<br /> they loved me, and I can imagine no
      heaven, no<br /> state of perfect bliss for me, in which they have no<br />
      share. If God hates me, because I love them,<br /> I cannot love him.<br />
      <br /> I cannot truthfully say that I look forward with any<br /> great
      degree of joy, to meeting with Haggai and<br /> Habakkuk; with Jeremiah,
      Nehemiah, Obadiah,<br /> Zechariah or Zephaniah; with Ezekiel, Micah, or<br />
      Malachi; or even with Jonah. From what little<br /> I have read of their
      writings, I have not formed a<br /> very high opinion of the social
      qualities of these<br /> gentlemen.<br /> <br /> I want to meet the persons I
      have known; and if<br /> there is another life, I want to meet the really
      and<br /> the truly great&mdash;men who have been broad enough to<br /> be
      tender, and great enough to be kind.<br /> <br /> Because I differ with my
      parents, because I am<br /> convinced that my father was wrong in some of<br />
      his religious opinions, Mr. Talmage insists that I dis-<br /> grace my
      parents. How did the Christian religion<br /> commence? Did not the first
      disciples advocate<br /> theories that their parents denied? Were they<br />
      <br /> 155<br /> <br /> not false,&mdash;in his sense of the word,&mdash;to
      their<br /> fathers and mothers? How could there have been<br /> any
      progress in this world, if children had not<br /> gone beyond their
      parents? Do you consider that<br /> the inventor of a steel plow cast a
      slur upon his<br /> father who scratched the ground with a wooden<br /> one?
      I do not consider that an invention by the<br /> son is a slander upon the
      father; I regard each<br /> invention simply as an improvement; and every<br />
      father should be exceedingly proud of an ingenious<br /> son. If Mr.
      Talmage has a son, it will be impossible<br /> for him to honor his father
      except by differing with<br /> him.<br /> <br /> It is very strange that Mr.
      Talmage, a believer in<br /> Christ, should object to any man for not
      loving his<br /> mother and his father, when his Master, according<br /> to
      the gospel of Saint Luke, says: "If any man<br /> "come to me, and hate not
      his father, and mother,<br /> "and wife, and children, and brethren, and
      sis-<br /> "ters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my<br />
      "disciple."<br /> <br /> According to this, I have to make my choice be-<br />
      tween my wife, my children, and Jesus Christ. I have<br /> concluded to
      stand by my folks&mdash;both in this world,<br /> and in "the world to
      come."<br /> <br /> 156<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage asks you
      whether, in your<br /> judgment, the Bible was a good, or an evil, to your<br />
      parents?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I think it was an evil. The worst thing<br />
      about my father was his religion. He would have<br /> been far happier, in
      my judgment, without it. I<br /> think I get more real joy out of life than
      he did.<br /> He was a man of a very great and tender heart. He<br /> was
      continually thinking&mdash;for many years of his<br /> life&mdash;of the
      thousands and thousands going down to<br /> eternal fire. That doctrine
      filled his days with<br /> gloom, and his eyes with tears. I think that my<br />
      father and mother would have been far happier had<br /> they believed as I
      do. How any one can get any<br /> joy out of the Christian religion is past
      my compre-<br /> hension. If that religion is true, hundreds of mil-<br />
      lions are now in hell, and thousands of millions yet<br /> unborn will be.
      How such a fact can form any part<br /> of the "glad tidings of great joy,"
      is amazing to me.<br /> It is impossible for me to love a being who would<br />
      create countless millions for eternal pain. It is<br /> impossible for me
      to worship the God of the Bible,<br /> or the God of Calvin, or the God of
      the Westminster<br /> Catechism.<br /> <br /> 157<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      I see that Mr. Talmage challenges you<br /> to read the fourteenth chapter
      of Saint John. Are<br /> you willing to accept the challenge; or have you<br />
      ever read that chapter?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I do not claim to be
      very courageous,<br /> but I have read that chapter, and am very glad that<br />
      Mr. Talmage has called attention to it. According<br /> to the gospels,
      Christ did many miracles. He healed<br /> the sick, gave sight to the
      blind, made the lame<br /> walk, and raised the dead. In the fourteenth
      chapter<br /> of Saint John, twelfth verse, I find the following:<br />
      <br /> "Verily, verily, I say unto you: He that believeth<br /> "on me, the
      works that I do shall he do also; and<br /> "greater works than these shall
      he do, because I go<br /> "unto my Father."<br /> <br /> I am willing to
      accept that as a true test of a<br /> believer. If Mr. Talmage really
      believes in Jesus<br /> Christ, he ought to be able to do at least as great<br />
      miracles as Christ is said to have done. Will Mr.<br /> Talmage have the
      kindness to read the fourteenth<br /> chapter of John, and then give me
      some proof, in<br /> accordance with that chapter, that he is a believer in<br />
      Jesus Christ? Will he have the kindness to perform<br /> a miracle?&mdash;for
      instance, produce a "local flood,"<br /> make a worm to smite a gourd, or
      "prepare a fish"?<br /> <br /> 158<br /> <br /> Can he do anything of that
      nature? Can he even<br /> cause a "vehement east wind"? What evidence,<br />
      according to the Bible, can Mr. Talmage give of his<br /> belief? How does
      he prove that he is a Christian?<br /> By hating infidels and maligning
      Christians? Let<br /> Mr. Talmage furnish the evidence, according to the<br />
      fourteenth chapter of Saint John, or forever after<br /> hold his peace.<br />
      <br /> He has my thanks for calling my attention to the<br /> fourteenth
      chapter of Saint John.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage charges
      that you are at-<br /> tempting to destroy the "chief solace of the world,"<br />
      without offering any substitute. How do you answer<br /> this?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. If he calls Christianity the "chief solace<br /> "of the
      world," and if by Christianity he means that all<br /> who do not believe
      in the inspiration of the Scrip-<br /> tures, and have no faith in Jesus
      Christ, are to be<br /> eternally damned, then I admit that I am doing the<br />
      best I can to take that "solace" from the human<br /> heart. I do not
      believe that the Bible, when prop-<br /> erly understood, is, or ever has
      been, a comfort to<br /> any human being. Surely, no good man can be<br />
      comforted by reading a book in which he finds that<br /> <br /> 159<br />
      <br /> a large majority of mankind have been sentenced to<br /> eternal
      fire. In the doctrine of total depravity there<br /> is no "solace." In the
      doctrine of "election" there can<br /> be no joy until the returns are in,
      and a majority<br /> found for you.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage
      says that you are taking<br /> away the world's medicines, and in place of
      anaes-<br /> thetics, in place of laudanum drops, you read an<br /> essay to
      the man in pain, on the absurdities of mor-<br /> phine and nervines in
      general.<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. It is exactly the other way. I say, let<br />
      us depend upon morphine, not upon prayer. Do<br /> not send for the
      minister&mdash;take a little laudanum.<br /> Do not read your Bible,&mdash;chloroform
      is better. Do<br /> not waste your time listening to meaningless ser-<br />
      mons, but take real, genuine soporifics.<br /> <br /> I regard the
      discoverer of ether as a benefactor.<br /> I look upon every great surgeon
      as a blessing to<br /> mankind. I regard one doctor, skilled in his profes-<br />
      sion, of more importance to the world than all the<br /> orthodox
      ministers.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage should remember that for hundreds<br />
      of years, the church fought, with all its power, the<br /> science of
      medicine. Priests used to cure diseases<br /> <br /> 160<br /> <br /> by
      selling little pieces of paper covered with cabalistic<br /> marks. They
      filled their treasuries by the sale of<br /> holy water. They healed the
      sick by relics&mdash;the teeth<br /> and ribs of saints, the finger-nails
      of departed wor-<br /> thies, and the hair of glorified virgins. Infidelity<br />
      said: "Send for the doctor." Theology said: "Stick<br /> "to the priest."
      Infidelity,&mdash;that is to say, science,&mdash;<br /> said: "Vaccinate
      him." The priest said: "Pray;&mdash;<br /> "I will sell you a charm." The
      doctor was regarded<br /> as a man who was endeavoring to take from God his<br />
      means of punishment. He was supposed to spike<br /> the artillery of
      Jehovah, to wet the powder of the<br /> Almighty, and to steal the flint
      from the musket of<br /> heavenly retribution.<br /> <br /> Infidelity has
      never relied upon essays, it has<br /> never relied upon words, it has
      never relied upon<br /> prayers, it has never relied upon angels or gods;
      it<br /> has relied upon the honest efforts of men and women.<br /> It has
      relied upon investigation, observation, experi-<br /> ence, and above all,
      upon human reason.<br /> <br /> We, in America, know how much prayers are<br />
      worth. We have lately seen millions of people upon<br /> their knees. What
      was the result?<br /> <br /> In the olden times, when a plague made its ap-<br />
      pearance, the people fell upon their knees and died.<br /> <br /> 161<br />
      <br /> When pestilence came, they rushed to their ca-<br /> thedrals, they
      implored their priests&mdash;and died. God<br /> had no pity upon his
      ignorant children. At last,<br /> Science came to the rescue. Science,&mdash;not
      in the<br /> attitude of prayer, with closed eyes, but in the atti-<br />
      tude of investigation, with open eyes,&mdash;looked for and<br />
      discovered some of the laws of health. Science<br /> found that cleanliness
      was far better than godliness. It<br /> said: Do not spend your time in
      praying;&mdash;clean your<br /> houses, clean your streets, clean
      yourselves. This pest-<br /> ilence is not a punishment. Health is not
      simply a favor<br /> of the gods. Health depends upon conditions, and<br />
      when the conditions are violated, disease is inevitable,<br /> and no God
      can save you. Health depends upon<br /> your surroundings, and when these
      are favorable,<br /> the roses are in your cheeks.<br /> <br /> We find in
      the Old Testament that God gave<br /> to Moses a thousand directions for
      ascertaining<br /> the presence of leprosy. Yet it never occurred<br /> to
      this God to tell Moses how to cure the disease.<br /> Within the lids of
      the Old Testament, we have no<br /> information upon a subject of such
      vital importance<br /> to mankind.<br /> <br /> It may, however, be claimed
      by Mr. Talmage, that<br /> this statement is a little too broad, and I will
      therefore<br /> <br /> 162<br /> <br /> give one recipe that I find in the
      fourteenth chapter<br /> of Leviticus:<br /> <br /> "Then shall the priest
      command to take for him<br /> " that is to be cleansed two birds alive and
      clean, and<br /> "cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop; and the priest<br />
      "shall command that one of the birds be killed in an<br /> "earthen vessel
      over running water. As for the<br /> "living bird, he shall take it, and
      the cedar wood,<br /> "and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them<br />
      "and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was<br /> "killed over
      the running water. And he shall<br /> "sprinkle upon him that is to be
      cleansed from the<br /> "leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him
      clean,<br /> "and shall let the living bird loose into the open<br />
      "field."<br /> <br /> Prophets were predicting evil&mdash;filling the
      country<br /> with their wails and cries, and yet it never occurred<br /> to
      them to tell one solitary thing of the slightest<br /> importance to
      mankind. Why did not these inspired<br /> men tell us how to cure some of
      the diseases that<br /> have decimated the world? Instead of spending<br />
      forty days and forty nights with Moses, telling him<br /> how to build a
      large tent, and how to cut the gar-<br /> ments of priests, why did God not
      give him a little<br /> useful information in respect to the laws of
      health?<br /> <br /> 163<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage must remember that the
      church has<br /> invented no anodynes, no anaesthetics, no medicines,<br />
      and has affected no cures. The doctors have not<br /> been inspired. All
      these useful things men have<br /> discovered for themselves, aided by no
      prophet and<br /> by no divine Savior. Just to the extent that man<br /> has
      depended upon the other world, he has failed to<br /> make the best of
      this. Just in the proportion that he<br /> has depended on his own efforts,
      he has advanced.<br /> The church has always said:<br /> <br /> "Consider the
      lilies of the field; they toil not,<br /> "neither do they spin." "Take no
      thought for the<br /> "morrow." Whereas, the real common sense of this<br />
      world has said: "No matter whether lilies toil and<br /> spin, or not, if
      you would succeed, you must work;<br /> you must take thought for the
      morrow, you must<br /> look beyond the present day, you must provide for<br />
      your wife and your children."<br /> <br /> What can I be expected to give as
      a substitute for<br /> perdition? It is enough to show that it does not<br />
      exist. What does a man want in place of a disease?<br /> Health. And what
      is better calculated to increase<br /> the happiness of mankind than to
      know that the<br /> doctrine of eternal pain is infinitely and absurdly<br />
      false?<br /> <br /> 164<br /> <br /> Take theology from the world, and natural
      Love<br /> remains, Science is still here, Music will not be lost,<br /> the
      page of History will still be open, the walls of<br /> the world will still
      be adorned with Art, and the<br /> niches rich with Sculpture.<br /> <br />
      Take theology from the world, and we all shall<br /> have a common hope,&mdash;and
      the fear of hell will be<br /> removed from every human heart.<br /> <br />
      Take theology from the world, and millions of<br /> men will be compelled
      to earn an honest living.<br /> Impudence will not tax credulity. The
      vampire of<br /> hypocrisy will not suck the blood of honest toil.<br />
      <br /> Take theology from the world, and the churches<br /> can be schools,
      and the cathedrals universities.<br /> <br /> Take theology from the world,
      and the money<br /> wasted on superstition will do away with want.<br />
      <br /> Take theology from the world, and every brain<br /> will find itself
      without a chain.<br /> <br /> There is a vast difference between what is
      called<br /> infidelity and theology.<br /> <br /> Infidelity is honest. When
      it reaches the confines<br /> of reason, it says: "I know no further."<br />
      <br /> Infidelity does not palm its guess upon an ignorant<br /> world as a
      demonstration.<br /> <br /> 165<br /> <br /> Infidelity proves nothing by
      slander&mdash;establishes<br /> nothing by abuse.<br /> <br /> Infidelity has
      nothing to hide. It has no "holy<br /> "of holies," except the abode of
      truth. It has no<br /> curtain that the hand of investigation has not the<br />
      right to draw aside. It lives in the cloudless light,<br /> in the very
      noon, of human eyes.<br /> <br /> Infidelity has no bible to be blasphemed.
      It does<br /> not cringe before an angry God.<br /> <br /> Infidelity says to
      every man: Investigate for<br /> yourself. There is no punishment for
      unbelief.<br /> <br /> Infidelity asks no protection from legislatures. It<br />
      wants no man fined because he contradicts its doc-<br /> trines.<br /> <br />
      Infidelity relies simply upon evidence&mdash;not evi-<br /> dence of the
      dead, but of the living.<br /> <br /> Infidelity has no infallible pope. It
      relies only<br /> upon infallible fact. It has no priest except the<br />
      interpreter of Nature. The universe is its church.<br /> Its bible is
      everything that is true. It implores every<br /> man to verify every word
      for himself, and it implores<br /> him to say, if he does not believe it,
      that he does<br /> not.<br /> <br /> Infidelity does not fear contradiction.
      It is not<br /> afraid of being laughed at. It invites the scrutiny<br />
      <br /> 166<br /> <br /> of all doubters, of all unbelievers. It does not rely<br />
      upon awe, but upon reason. It says to the whole<br /> world: It is
      dangerous not to think. It is dan-<br /> gerous not to be honest. It is
      dangerous not to<br /> investigate. It is dangerous not to follow where<br />
      your reason leads.<br /> <br /> Infidelity requires every man to judge for
      himself.<br /> Infidelity preserves the manhood of man.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Mr. Talmage also says that you are<br /> trying to put out the light-houses
      on the coast of the<br /> next world; that you are "about to leave
      everybody<br /> "in darkness at the narrows of death"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      There can be no necessity for these<br /> light-houses, unless the God of
      Mr. Talmage has<br /> planted rocks and reefs within that unknown sea.<br />
      If there is no hell, there is no need of any light-<br /> house on the
      shores of the next world; and only<br /> those are interested in keeping up
      these pretended<br /> light-houses who are paid for trimming invisible<br />
      wicks and supplying the lamps with allegorical oil.<br /> Mr. Talmage is
      one of these light-house keepers,<br /> and he knows that if it is
      ascertained that the coast<br /> is not dangerous, the light-house will be
      abandoned,<br /> and the keeper will have to find employment else-<br />
      <br /> 167<br /> <br /> where. As a matter of fact, every church is a use-<br />
      less light-house. It warns us only against breakers<br /> that do not
      exist. Whenever a mariner tells one of<br /> the keepers that there is no
      danger, then all the<br /> keepers combine to destroy the reputation of
      that<br /> mariner.<br /> <br /> No one has returned from the other world to
      tell<br /> us whether they have light-houses on that shore or<br /> not; or
      whether the light-houses on this shore&mdash;one<br /> of which Mr. Talmage
      is tending&mdash;have ever sent a<br /> cheering ray across the sea.<br />
      <br /> Nature has furnished every human being with<br /> a light more or
      less brilliant, more or less powerful.<br /> That light is Reason; and he
      who blows that light<br /> out, is in utter darkness. It has been the
      business of<br /> the church for centuries to extinguish the lamp of the<br />
      mind, and to convince the people that their own<br /> reason is utterly
      unreliable. The church has asked<br /> all men to rely only upon the light
      of the church.<br /> <br /> Every priest has been not only a light-house but<br />
      a guide-board. He has threatened eternal damna-<br /> tion to all who
      travel on some other road. These<br /> guide-boards have been toll-gates,
      and the principal<br /> reason why the churches have wanted people to go<br />
      their road is, that tolls might be collected. They<br /> <br /> 168<br />
      <br /> have regarded unbelievers as the owners of turnpikes<br /> do people
      who go 'cross lots. The toll-gate man<br /> always tells you that other
      roads are dangerous&mdash;<br /> filled with quagmires and quicksands.<br />
      <br /> Every church is a kind of insurance society, and<br /> proposes, for
      a small premium, to keep you from<br /> eternal fire. Of course, the man
      who tells you that<br /> there is to be no fire, interferes with the
      business,<br /> and is denounced as a malicious meddler and blas-<br />
      phemer. The fires of this world sustain the same<br /> relation to
      insurance companies that the fires of the<br /> next do to the churches.<br />
      <br /> Mr. Talmage also insists that I am breaking up the<br />
      "life-boats." Why should a ship built by infinite<br /> wisdom, by an
      infinite shipbuilder, carry life-boats?<br /> The reason we have life-boats
      now is, that we are<br /> not entirely sure of the ship. We know that man<br />
      has not yet found out how to make a ship that can<br /> certainly brave all
      the dangers of the deep. For this<br /> reason we carry life-boats. But
      infinite wisdom must<br /> surely build ships that do not need life-boats.
      Is there<br /> to be a wreck at last? Is God's ship to go down in<br />
      storm and darkness? Will it be necessary at last to<br /> forsake his ship
      and depend upon life-boats?<br /> <br /> For my part, I do not wish to be
      rescued by a life-<br /> <br /> 169<br /> <br /> boat. When the ship, bearing
      the whole world, goes<br /> down, I am willing to go down with it&mdash;with
      my<br /> wife, with my children, and with those I have loved.<br /> I will
      not slip ashore in an orthodox canoe with<br /> somebody else's folks,&mdash;I
      will stay with my own.<br /> <br /> What a picture is presented by the
      church! A few<br /> in life's last storm are to be saved; and the saved,<br />
      when they reach shore, are to look back with joy<br /> upon the great ship
      going down to the eternal depths!<br /> This is what I call the unutterable
      meanness of or-<br /> thodox Christianity.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage speaks of
      the "meanness of in-<br /> "fidelity."<br /> <br /> The meanness of orthodox
      Christianity permits the<br /> husband to be saved, and to be ineffably
      happy, while<br /> the wife of his bosom is suffering the tortures of hell.<br />
      <br /> The meanness of orthodox Christianity tells the<br /> boy that he can
      go to heaven and have an eternity<br /> of bliss, and that this bliss will
      not even be clouded<br /> by the fact that the mother who bore him writhes
      in<br /> eternal pain.<br /> <br /> The meanness of orthodox Christianity
      allows<br /> a soul to be so captivated with the companionship<br /> of
      angels as to forget all the old loves and friend-<br /> ships of this
      world.<br /> <br /> 170<br /> <br /> The meanness of orthodox Christianity,
      its un-<br /> speakable selfishness, allows a soul in heaven to exult<br />
      in the fact of its own salvation, and at the same time<br /> to care
      nothing for the damnation of all the rest.<br /> <br /> The orthodox
      Christian says that if he can only<br /> save his little soul, if he can
      barely squeeze into<br /> heaven, if he can only get past Saint Peter's
      gate,<br /> if he can by hook or crook climb up the opposite<br /> bank of
      Jordan, if he can get a harp in his hand, it<br /> matters not to him what
      becomes of brother or<br /> sister, father or mother, wife or child. He is
      willing<br /> that they should burn if he can sing.<br /> <br /> Oh, the
      unutterable meanness of orthodox Chris-<br /> tianity, the infinite
      heartlessness of the orthodox<br /> angels, who with tearless eyes will
      forever gaze upon<br /> the agonies of those who were once blood of their<br />
      blood and flesh of their flesh!<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage describes a picture
      of the scourging<br /> of Christ, painted by Rubens, and he tells us that<br />
      he was so appalled by this picture&mdash;by the sight of<br /> the naked
      back, swollen and bleeding&mdash;that he could<br /> not have lived had he
      continued to look; yet this<br /> same man, who could not bear to gaze upon
      a<br /> painted pain, expects to be perfectly happy in heaven,<br /> while
      countiess billions of actual&mdash;not painted&mdash;men,<br /> <br /> 171<br />
      <br /> women, and children writhe&mdash;not in a pictured flame,<br /> but
      in the real and quenchless fires of hell.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr.
      Talmage also claims that we are<br /> indebted to Christianity for schools,
      colleges, univer-<br /> sities, hospitals and asylums?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      This shows that Mr. Talmage has not<br /> read the history of the world.
      Long before Chris-<br /> tianity had a place, there were vast libraries.
      There<br /> were thousands of schools before a Christian existed<br /> on
      the earth. There were hundreds of hospitals<br /> before a line of the New
      Testament was written.<br /> Hundreds of years before Christ, there were
      hospitals<br /> in India,&mdash;not only for men, women and children, but<br />
      even for beasts. There were hospitals in Egypt long<br /> before Moses was
      born. They knew enough then<br /> to cure insanity with music. They
      surrounded the<br /> insane with flowers, and treated them with kindness.<br />
      <br /> The great libraries at Alexandria were not Chris-<br /> tian. The
      most intellectual nation of the Middle<br /> Ages was not Christian. While
      Christians were<br /> imprisoning people for saying that the earth is
      round,<br /> the Moors in Spain were teaching geography with<br /> globes.
      They had even calculated the circumference<br /> of the earth by the tides
      of the Red Sea.<br /> <br /> Where did education come from? For a thousand<br />
      <br /> 172<br /> <br /> years Christianity destroyed books and paintings and<br />
      statues. For a thousand years Christianity was filled<br /> with hatred
      toward every effort of the human mind.<br /> We got paper from the Moors.
      Printing had been<br /> known thousands of years before, in China. A few<br />
      manuscripts, containing a portion of the literature of<br /> Greece, a few
      enriched with the best thoughts of<br /> the Roman world, had been
      preserved from the<br /> general wreck and ruin wrought by Christian hate.<br />
      These became the seeds of intellectual progress.<br /> For a thousand years
      Christianity controlled Europe.<br /> The Mohammedans were far in advance
      of the<br /> Christians with hospitals and asylums and institutions<br /> of
      learning.<br /> <br /> Just in proportion that we have done away with<br />
      what is known as orthodox Christianity, humanity<br /> has taken its place.
      Humanity has built all the asy-<br /> lums, all the hospitals. Humanity,
      not Christianity,<br /> has done these things. The people of this country<br />
      are all willing to be taxed that the insane may be<br /> cared for, that
      the sick, the helpless, and the desti-<br /> tute may be provided for, not
      because they are<br /> Christians, but because they are humane; and they<br />
      are not humane because they are Christians.<br /> <br /> The colleges of
      this country have been poisoned by<br /> <br /> 173<br /> <br /> theology, and
      their usefulness almost destroyed. Just<br /> in proportion that they have
      gotten from ecclesiastical<br /> control, they have become a good. That
      college, to-<br /> day, which has the most religion has the least true<br />
      learning; and that college which is the nearest free,<br /> does the most
      good. Colleges that pit Moses against<br /> modern geology, that undertake
      to overthrow the<br /> Copernican system by appealing to Joshua, have<br />
      done, and are doing, very little good in this world.<br /> <br /> Suppose
      that in the first century Pagans had said<br /> to Christians: Where are
      your hospitals, where are<br /> your asylums, where are your works of
      charity, where<br /> are your colleges and universities?<br /> <br /> The
      Christians undoubtedly would have replied:<br /> We have not been in power.
      There are but few<br /> of us. We have been persecuted to that degree<br />
      that it has been about as much as we could do to<br /> maintain ourselves.<br />
      <br /> Reasonable Pagans would have regarded such an<br /> answer as
      perfectly satisfactory. Yet that question<br /> could have been asked of
      Christianity after it had<br /> held the reins of power for a thousand
      years, and<br /> Christians would have been compelled to say: We<br /> have
      no universities, we have no colleges, we have<br /> no real asylums.<br />
      <br /> 174<br /> <br /> The Christian now asks of the atheist: Where<br /> is
      your asylum, where is your hospital, where is your<br /> university? And
      the atheist answers: There have<br /> been but few atheists. The world is
      not yet suffi-<br /> ciently advanced to produce them. For hundreds<br />
      and hundreds of years, the minds of men have been<br /> darkened by the
      superstitions of Christianity. Priests<br /> have thundered against human
      knowledge, have de-<br /> nounced human reason, and have done all within<br />
      their power to prevent the real progress of mankind.<br /> <br /> You must
      also remember that Christianity has<br /> made more lunatics than it ever
      provided asylums<br /> for. Christianity has driven more men and women<br />
      crazy than all other religions combined. Hundreds<br /> and thousands and
      millions have lost their reason in<br /> contemplating the monstrous
      falsehoods of Chris-<br /> tianity. Thousands of mothers, thinking of their<br />
      sons in hell&mdash;thousands of fathers, believing their<br /> boys and
      girls in perdition, have lost their reason.<br /> <br /> So, let it be
      distinctly understood, that Christianity<br /> has made ten lunatics&mdash;twenty&mdash;one
      hundred&mdash;<br /> where it has provided an asylum for one.<br /> <br />
      Mr. Talmage also speaks of the hospitals. When<br /> we take into
      consideration the wars that have been<br /> waged on account of religion,
      the countless thou-<br /> <br /> 175<br /> <br /> sands who have been maimed
      and wounded, through<br /> all the years, by wars produced by theology&mdash;then
      I<br /> say that Christianity has not built hospitals enough<br /> to take
      care of her own wounded&mdash;not enough to<br /> take care of one in a
      hundred. Where Christianity<br /> has bound up the wounds of one, it has
      pierced the<br /> bodies of a hundred others with sword and spear,<br />
      with bayonet and ball. Where she has provided<br /> one bed in a hospital,
      she has laid away a hundred<br /> bodies in bloody graves.<br /> <br /> Of
      course I do not expect the church to do<br /> anything but beg. Churches
      produce nothing. They<br /> are like the lilies of the field. "They toil
      not, neither<br /> "do they spin, yet Solomon in all his glory was not<br />
      "arrayed like most of them."<br /> <br /> The churches raise no corn nor
      wheat. They<br /> simply collect tithes. They carry the alms' dish.<br />
      They pass the plate. They take toll. Of course<br /> a mendicant is not
      expected to produce anything.<br /> He does not support,&mdash;he is
      supported. The church<br /> does not help. She receives, she devours, she<br />
      consumes, and she produces only discord. She ex-<br /> changes mistakes for
      provisions, faith for food,<br /> prayers for pence. The church is a
      beggar. But we<br /> have this consolation: In this age of the world, this<br />
      <br /> 176<br /> <br /> beggar is not on horseback, and even the walking is<br />
      not good.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage says that infidels have<br />
      done no good?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Well, let us see. In the first
      place,<br /> what is an "infidel"? He is simply a man in advance<br /> of
      his time. He is an intellectual pioneer. He is<br /> the dawn of a new day.
      He is a gentleman with an<br /> idea of his own, for which he gave no
      receipt to the<br /> church. He is a man who has not been branded as<br />
      the property of some one else. An "infidel" is one<br /> who has made a
      declaration of independence. In<br /> other words, he is a man who has had
      a doubt. To<br /> have a doubt means that you have thought upon<br /> the
      subject&mdash;that you have investigated the question;<br /> and he who
      investigates any religion will doubt.<br /> <br /> All the advance that has
      been made in the religious<br /> world has been made by "infidels," by
      "heretics,"<br /> by "skeptics," by doubters,&mdash;that is to say, by<br />
      thoughtful men. The doubt does not come from the<br /> ignorant members of
      your congregations. Heresy is<br /> not born of stupidity,&mdash;it is not
      the child of the brain-<br /> less. He who is so afraid of hurting the
      reputation<br /> of his father and mother that he refuses to advance,<br />
      <br /> 177<br /> <br /> is not a "heretic." The "heretic" is not true to<br />
      falsehood. Orthodoxy is. He who stands faithfully<br /> by a mistake is
      "orthodox." He who, discovering<br /> that it is a mistake, has the courage
      to say so, is an<br /> "infidel."<br /> <br /> An infidel is an intellectual
      discoverer&mdash;one who<br /> finds new isles, new continents, in the vast
      realm of<br /> thought. The dwellers on the orthodox shore de-<br /> nounce
      this brave sailor of the seas as a buccaneer.<br /> <br /> And yet we are
      told that the thinkers of new<br /> thoughts have never been of value to
      the world.<br /> Voltaire did more for human liberty than all the<br />
      orthodox ministers living and dead. He broke a<br /> thousand times more
      chains than Luther. Luther<br /> simply substituted his chain for that of
      the Catholics.<br /> Voltaire had none. The Encyclopaedists of France<br />
      did more for liberty than all the writers upon theology.<br /> Bruno did
      more for mankind than millions of "be-<br /> "lievers." Spinoza contributed
      more to the growth<br /> of the human intellect than all the orthodox
      theolo-<br /> gians.<br /> <br /> Men have not done good simply because they
      have<br /> believed this or that doctrine. They have done good<br /> in the
      intellectual world as they have thought and<br /> secured for others the
      liberty to think and to ex-<br /> <br /> 178<br /> <br /> press their
      thoughts. They have done good in the<br /> physical world by teaching their
      fellows how to<br /> triumph over the obstructions of nature. Every<br />
      man who has taught his fellow-man to think, has<br /> been a benefactor.
      Every one who has supplied his<br /> fellow-men with facts, and insisted
      upon their right<br /> to think, has been a blessing to his kind.<br />
      <br /> Mr. Talmage, in order to show what Christians<br /> have done, points
      us to Whitefield, Luther, Oberlin,<br /> Judson, Martyn, Bishop Mcllvaine
      and Hannah<br /> More. I would not for one moment compare George<br />
      Whitefield with the inventor of movable type, and<br /> there is no
      parallel between Frederick Oberlin and<br /> the inventor of paper; not the
      slightest between<br /> Martin Luther and the discoverer of the New World;<br />
      not the least between Adoniram Judson and the in-<br /> ventor of the
      reaper, nor between Henry Martyn<br /> and the discoverer of photography.
      Of what use to<br /> the world was Bishop Mcllvaine, compared with<br /> the
      inventor of needles? Of what use were a<br /> hundred such priests compared
      with the inventor<br /> of matches, or even of clothes-pins? Suppose that<br />
      Hannah More had never lived? about the same<br /> number would read her
      writings now. It is hardly fair<br /> to compare her with the inventor of
      the steamship?<br /> <br /> 179<br /> <br /> The progress of the world&mdash;its
      present improved<br /> condition&mdash;can be accounted for only by the
      discov-<br /> eries of genius, only by men who have had the<br /> courage to
      express their honest thoughts.<br /> <br /> After all, the man who invented
      the telescope<br /> found out more about heaven than the closed eyes of<br />
      prayer had ever discovered. I feel absolutely certain<br /> that the
      inventor of the steam engine was a greater<br /> benefactor to mankind than
      the writer of the Presby-<br /> terian creed. I may be mistaken, but I
      think that<br /> railways have done more to civilize mankind, than any<br />
      system of theology. I believe that the printing press<br /> has done more
      for the world than the pulpit. It is<br /> my opinion that the discoveries
      of Kepler did a<br /> thousand times more to enlarge the minds of men<br />
      than the prophecies of Daniel. I feel under far<br /> greater obligation to
      Humboldt than to Haggai.<br /> The inventor of the plow did more good than
      the<br /> maker of the first rosary&mdash;because, say what you<br /> will,
      plowing is better than praying; we can live by<br /> plowing without
      praying, but we can not live by<br /> praying without plowing. So I put my
      faith in the<br /> plow.<br /> <br /> As Jehovah has ceased to make garments
      for his<br /> children,&mdash;as he has stopped making coats of skins,<br />
      <br /> 180<br /> <br /> I have great respect for the inventors of the
      spinning-<br /> jenny and the sewing machine. As no more laws<br /> are
      given from Sinai, I have admiration for the real<br /> statesmen. As
      miracles have ceased, I rely on<br /> medicine, and on a reasonable
      compliance with the<br /> conditions of health.<br /> <br /> I have infinite
      respect for the inventors, the<br /> thinkers, the discoverers, and above
      all, for the un-<br /> known millions who have, without the hope of fame,<br />
      lived and labored for the ones they loved.<br /> <br /> <br /> <a
      name="link0007" id="link0007"></a><br /> <br /> <br /> <big><b>FIFTH
      INTERVIEW.</b></big><br /> <br /> <i>Parson. You had belter join the church;
      it is<br /> the safer way.<br /> <br /> Sinner. I can't live up to your
      doctrines, and you<br /> know it.<br /> <br /> Parson. Well, you can come as
      near it in the<br /> church as out; and forgiveness<br /> <br /> will be
      easier if you join us.<br /> <br /> Sinner. What do you mean by that?<br />
      <br /> Parson. I will tell you. If you join the church,<br /> and happen to
      back-slide now and then, Christ will<br /> say to his Father: "That man is
      a "friend of mine,<br /> and you may charge his account to me."</i><br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. What have you to say about the<br /> fifth sermon of
      the Rev. Mr. Talmage in reply<br /> to you?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The
      text from which he preached is:<br /> "Do men gather grapes of thorns, or
      figs of thistles?"<br /> I am compelled to answer these questions in the<br />
      negative. That is one reason why I am an infidel.<br /> I do not believe
      that anybody can gather grapes of<br /> thorns, or figs of thistles. That
      is exactly my doctrine.<br /> But the doctrine of the church is, that you
      can. The<br /> <br /> 184<br /> <br /> church says, that just at the last, no
      matter if you<br /> have spent your whole life in raising thorns and
      thistles,<br /> in planting and watering and hoeing and plowing<br /> thorns
      and thistles&mdash;that just at the last, if you will<br /> repent, between
      hoeing the last thistle and taking the<br /> last breath, you can reach out
      the white and palsied<br /> hand of death and gather from every thorn a
      cluster<br /> of grapes and from every thistle an abundance of<br /> figs.
      The church insists that in this way you can<br /> gather enough grapes and
      figs to last you through all<br /> eternity.<br /> <br /> My doctrine is,
      that he who raises thorns must<br /> harvest thorns. If you sow thorns, you
      must reap<br /> thorns; and there is no way by which an innocent<br /> being
      can have the thorns you raise thrust into his<br /> brow, while you gather
      his grapes.<br /> <br /> But Christianity goes even further than this. It<br />
      insists that a man can plant grapes and gather thorns.<br /> Mr. Talmage
      insists that, no matter how good you<br /> are, no matter how kind, no
      matter how much you<br /> love your wife and children, no matter how many<br />
      self-denying acts you do, you will not be allowed to<br /> eat of the
      grapes you raise; that God will step be-<br /> tween you and the natural
      consequences of your<br /> goodness, and not allow you to reap what you
      sow.<br /> <br /> 185<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage insists, that if you have no
      faith in the<br /> Lord Jesus Christ, although you have been good<br />
      here, you will reap eternal pain as your harvest; that<br /> the effect of
      honesty and kindness will not be peace<br /> and joy, but agony and pain.
      So that the church<br /> does insist not only that you can gather grapes
      from<br /> thorns, but thorns from grapes.<br /> <br /> I believe exactly the
      other way. If a man is a<br /> good man here, dying will not change him,
      and he<br /> will land on the shore of another world&mdash;if there is<br />
      one&mdash;the same good man that he was when he left<br /> this; and I do
      not believe there is any God in this<br /> universe who can afford to damn
      a good man. This<br /> God will say to this man: You loved your wife,<br />
      your children, and your friends, and I love you.<br /> You treated others
      with kindness; I will treat you<br /> in the same way. But Mr. Talmage
      steps up to<br /> his God, nudges his elbow, and says: Although he<br /> was
      a very good man, he belonged to no church;<br /> he was a blasphemer; he
      denied the whale story, and<br /> after I explained that Jonah was only in
      the whale's<br /> mouth, he still denied it; and thereupon Mr. Tal-<br />
      mage expects that his infinite God will fly in a<br /> passion, and in a
      perfect rage will say: What! did<br /> he deny that story? Let him be
      eternally damned!<br /> <br /> 186<br /> <br /> Not only this, but Mr. Talmage
      insists that a man<br /> may have treated his wife like a wild beast; may
      have<br /> trampled his child beneath the feet of his rage; may<br /> have
      lived a life of dishonesty, of infamy, and yet,<br /> having repented on
      his dying bed, having made his<br /> peace with God through the
      intercession of his Son,<br /> he will be welcomed in heaven with shouts of
      joy.<br /> I deny it. I do not believe that angels can be so<br /> quickly
      made from rascals. I have but little confi-<br /> dence in repentance
      without restitution, and a hus-<br /> band who has driven a wife to
      insanity and death by<br /> his cruelty&mdash;afterward repenting and
      finding himself<br /> in heaven, and missing his wife,&mdash;were he worthy
      to<br /> be an angel, would wander through all the gulfs of<br /> hell until
      he clasped her once again..<br /> <br /> Now, the next question is, What
      must be done with<br /> those who are sometimes good and sometimes bad?<br />
      That is my condition. If there is another world, I<br /> expect to have the
      same opportunity of behaving<br /> myself that I have here. If, when I get
      there, I fail<br /> to act as I should, I expect to reap what I sow. If,<br />
      when I arrive at the New Jerusalem, I go into the<br /> thorn business, I
      expect to harvest what I plant. If<br /> I am wise enough to start a
      vineyard, I expect to<br /> have grapes in the early fall. But if I do
      there as I<br /> <br /> 187<br /> <br /> have done here&mdash;plant some
      grapes and some thorns,<br /> and harvest them together&mdash;I expect to
      fare very<br /> much as I have fared here. But I expect year by<br /> year
      to grow wiser, to plant fewer thorns every<br /> spring, and more grapes.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage charges that you have<br /> taken the
      ground that the Bible is a cruel book, and<br /> has produced cruel people?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes, I have taken that ground, and I<br /> maintain
      it. The Bible was produced by cruel people,<br /> and in its turn it has
      produced people like its authors.<br /> The extermination of the Canaanites
      was cruel.<br /> Most of the laws of Moses were bloodthirsty and<br />
      cruel. Hundreds of offences were punishable by<br /> death, while now, in
      civilized countries, there are only<br /> two crimes for which the
      punishment is capital. I<br /> charge that Moses and Joshua and David and
      Samuel<br /> and Solomon were cruel. I believe that to read and<br />
      believe the Old Testament naturally makes a man<br /> careless of human
      life. That book has produced<br /> hundreds of religious wars, and it has
      furnished the<br /> battle-cries of bigotry for fifteen hundred years.<br />
      <br /> The Old Testament is filled with cruelty, but its<br /> cruelty stops
      with this world, its malice ends with<br /> <br /> 188<br /> <br /> death;
      whenever its victim has reached the grave,<br /> revenge is satisfied. Not
      so with the New Testament.<br /> It pursues its victim forever. After
      death, comes<br /> hell; after the grave, the worm that never dies. So<br />
      that, as a matter of fact, the New Testament is in-<br /> finitely more
      cruel than the Old.<br /> <br /> Nothing has so tended to harden the human
      heart<br /> as the doctrine of eternal punishment, and that<br /> passage:
      "He that believeth and is baptized shall be<br /> "saved, and he that
      believeth not shall be damned,"<br /> has shed more blood than all the
      other so-called<br /> "sacred books" of all this world.<br /> <br /> I insist
      that the Bible is cruel. The Bible invented<br /> instruments of torture.
      The Bible laid the foundations<br /> of the Inquisition. The Bible
      furnished the fagots and<br /> the martyrs. The Bible forged chains not
      only for the<br /> hands, but for the brains of men. The Bible was at<br />
      the bottom of the massacre of St. Bartholomew.<br /> Every man who has been
      persecuted for religion's<br /> sake has been persecuted by the Bible. That
      sacred<br /> book has been a beast of prey.<br /> <br /> The truth is,
      Christians have been good in spite of<br /> the Bible. The Bible has lived
      upon the reputations of<br /> good men and good women,&mdash;men and women
      who<br /> were good notwithstanding the brutality they found<br /> <br />
      <br /> 189<br /> <br /> upon the inspired page. Men have said: "My mother<br />
      "believed in the Bible; my mother was good; there-<br /> "fore, the Bible
      is good," when probably the mother<br /> never read a chapter in it.<br />
      <br /> The Bible produced the Church of Rome, and<br /> Torquemada was a
      product of the Bible. Philip of<br /> Spain and the Duke of Alva were
      produced by the<br /> Bible. For thirty years Europe was one vast battle-<br />
      field, and the war was produced by the Bible. The re-<br /> vocation of the
      Edict of Nantes was produced by the<br /> sacred Scriptures. The
      instruments of torture&mdash;the<br /> pincers, the thumb-screws, the
      racks, were produced<br /> by the word of God. The Quakers of New England<br />
      were whipped and burned by the Bible&mdash;their children<br /> were stolen
      by the Bible. The slave-ship had for its<br /> sails the leaves of the
      Bible. Slavery was upheld in<br /> the United States by the Bible. The
      Bible was the<br /> auction-block. More than this, worse than this,<br />
      infinitely beyond the computation of imagination, the<br /> despotisms of
      the old world all rested and still rest<br /> upon the Bible. "The powers
      that be" were sup-<br /> posed to have been "ordained of God;" and he who<br />
      rose against his king periled his soul.<br /> <br /> In this connection, and
      in order to show the state<br /> of society when the church had entire
      control of civil<br /> <br /> 190<br /> <br /> and ecclesiastical affairs, it
      may be well enough to<br /> read the following, taken from the <i>New York
      Sun</i> of<br /> March 21, 1882. From this little extract, it will be<br />
      easy in the imagination to re-organize the government<br /> that then
      existed, and to see clearly the state of so-<br /> ciety at that time. This
      can be done upon the same<br /> principle that one scale tells of the
      entire fish, or one<br /> bone of the complete animal:<br /> <br /> "From
      records in the State archives of Hesse-<br /> "Darmstadt, dating back to
      the thirteenth century,<br /> "it appears that the public executioner's fee
      for boiling<br /> "a criminal in oil was twenty-four florins; for decapi-<br />
      "tating with the sword, fifteen florins and-a-half; for<br /> "quartering,
      the same; for breaking on the wheel,<br /> "five florins, thirty kreuzers;
      for tearing a man to<br /> "pieces, eighteen florins. Ten florins per head
      was<br /> "his charge for hanging, and he burned delinquents<br /> "alive at
      the rate of fourteen florins apiece. For ap-<br /> "plying the 'Spanish
      boot' his fee was only two<br /> "florins. Five florins were paid to him
      every time he<br /> "subjected a refractory witness to the torture of the<br />
      "rack. The same amount was his due for 'branding<br /> "'the sign of the
      gallows with a red-hot iron upon<br /> "'the back, forehead, or cheek of a
      thief,' as well as<br /> "for 'cutting off the nose and ears of a slanderer
      or<br /> <br /> 191<br /> <br /> "'blasphemer.' Flogging with rods was a cheap<br />
      "punishment, its remuneration being fixed at three<br /> "florins, thirty
      kreuzers."<br /> <br /> The Bible has made men cruel. It is a cruel book.<br />
      And yet, amidst its thorns, amidst its thistles, amidst<br /> its nettles
      and its swords and pikes, there are some<br /> flowers, and these I wish,
      in common with all good<br /> men, to save.<br /> <br /> I do not believe
      that men have ever been made<br /> merciful in war by reading the Old
      Testament. I do<br /> not believe that men have ever been prompted to<br />
      break the chain of a slave by reading the Pentateuch.<br /> The question is
      not whether Florence Nightingale and<br /> Miss Dix were cruel. I have said
      nothing about<br /> John Howard, nothing about Abbott Lawrence.<br /> I say
      nothing about people in this connection. The<br /> question is: Is the
      Bible a cruel book? not: Was<br /> Miss Nightingale a cruel woman? There
      have been<br /> thousands and thousands of loving, tender and char-<br />
      itable Mohammedans. Mohammedan mothers love<br /> their children as well as
      Christian mothers can.<br /> Mohammedans have died in defence of the Koran&mdash;<br />
      died for the honor of an impostor. There were<br /> millions of charitable
      people in India&mdash;millions in<br /> Egypt&mdash;and I am not sure that
      the world has ever<br /> <br /> 192<br /> <br /> produced people who loved one
      another better than<br /> the Egyptians.<br /> <br /> I think there are many
      things in the Old Testament<br /> calculated to make man cruel. Mr. Talmage
      asks:<br /> "What has been the effect upon your children? As<br /> "they
      have become more and more fond of the<br /> "Scriptures have they become
      more and more fond<br /> "of tearing off the wings of flies and pinning
      grass-<br /> "hoppers and robbing birds' nests?"<br /> <br /> I do not
      believe that reading the bible would make<br /> them tender toward flies or
      grasshoppers. According<br /> to that book, God used to punish animals for
      the<br /> crimes of their owners. He drowned the animals in<br /> a flood.
      He visited cattle with disease. He bruised<br /> them to death with
      hailstones&mdash;killed them by the<br /> thousand. Will the reading of
      these things make<br /> children kind to animals? So, the whole system of<br />
      sacrifices in the Old Testament is calculated to harden<br /> the heart.
      The butchery of oxen and lambs, the killing<br /> of doves, the perpetual
      destruction of life, the con-<br /> tinual shedding of blood&mdash;these
      things, if they have<br /> any tendency, tend only to harden the heart of
      child-<br /> hood.<br /> <br /> The Bible does not stop simply with the
      killing of<br /> animals. The Jews were commanded to kill their<br /> <br />
      193<br /> <br /> neighbors&mdash;not only the men, but the women; not<br />
      only the women, but the babes. In accordance with<br /> the command of God,
      the Jews killed not only their<br /> neighbors, but their own brothers; and
      according to<br /> this book, which is the foundation, as Mr. Talmage<br />
      believes, of all mercy, men were commanded to kill<br /> their wives
      because they differed with them on the<br /> subject of religion.<br />
      <br /> Nowhere in the world can be found laws more un-<br /> just and cruel
      than in the Old Testament.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage wants
      you to tell where<br /> the cruelty of the Bible crops out in the lives of
      Chris-<br /> tians?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. In the first place, millions
      of Christians<br /> have been persecutors. Did they get the idea of<br />
      persecution from the Bible? Will not every honest<br /> man admit that the
      early Christians, by reading the<br /> Old Testament, became convinced that
      it was not<br /> only their privilege, but their duty, to destroy heathen<br />
      nations? Did they not, by reading the same book,<br /> come to the
      conclusion that it was their solemn duty<br /> to extirpate heresy and
      heretics? According to the<br /> New Testament, nobody could be saved
      unless he<br /> believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. The early Chris-<br />
      <br /> 194<br /> <br /> tians believed this dogma. They also believed that<br />
      they had a right to defend themselves and their<br /> children from
      "heretics."<br /> <br /> We all admit that a man has a right to defend his<br />
      children against the assaults of a would-be murderer,<br /> and he has the
      right to carry this defence to the<br /> extent of killing the assailant.
      If we have the right<br /> to kill people who are simply trying to kill the
      bodies<br /> of our children, of course we have the right to kill<br /> them
      when they are endeavoring to assassinate, not<br /> simply their bodies,
      but their souls. It was in this<br /> way Christians reasoned. If the
      Testament is right,<br /> their reasoning was correct. Whoever believes the<br />
      New Testament literally&mdash;whoever is satisfied that it<br /> is
      absolutely the word of God, will become a perse-<br /> cutor. All religious
      persecution has been, and is, in<br /> exact harmony with the teachings of
      the Old and<br /> New Testaments. Of course I mean with some of<br /> the
      teachings. I admit that there are passages in<br /> both the Old and New
      Testaments against persecu-<br /> tion. These are passages quoted only in
      time of<br /> peace. Others are repeated to feed the flames of<br /> war.<br />
      <br /> I find, too, that reading the Bible and believing the<br /> Bible do
      not prevent even ministers from telling false-<br /> <br /> 195<br /> <br />
      hoods about their opponents. I find that the Rev.<br /> Mr. Talmage is
      willing even to slander the dead,&mdash;<br /> that he is willing to stain
      the memory of a Christian,<br /> and that he does not hesitate to give
      circulation<br /> to what he knows to be untrue. Mr. Talmage<br /> has
      himself, I believe, been the subject of a church<br /> trial. How many of
      the Christian witnesses against<br /> him, in his judgment, told the truth?
      Yet they were<br /> all Bible readers and Bible believers. What effect, in<br />
      his judgment, did the reading of the Bible have upon<br /> his enemies? Is
      he willing to admit that the testi-<br /> mony of a Bible, reader and
      believer is true? Is he<br /> willing to accept the testimony even of
      ministers?<br /> &mdash;of his brother ministers? Did reading the Bible<br />
      make them bad people? Was it a belief in the Bible<br /> that colored their
      testimony? Or, was it a belief in<br /> the Bible that made Mr. Talmage
      deny the truth of<br /> their statements?<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr.
      Talmage charges you with having<br /> said that the Scriptures are a
      collection of polluted<br /> writings?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I have
      never said such a thing. I have<br /> said, and I still say, that there are
      passages in the<br /> Bible unfit to be read&mdash;passages that never
      should<br /> <br /> 196<br /> <br /> have been written&mdash;passages, whether
      inspired or<br /> uninspired, that can by no possibility do any human<br />
      being any good. I have always admitted that there<br /> are good passages
      in the Bible&mdash;many good, wise<br /> and just laws&mdash;many things
      calculated to make men<br /> better&mdash;many things calculated to make
      men worse.<br /> I admit that the Bible is a mixture of good and bad,<br />
      of truth and falsehood, of history and fiction, of sense<br /> and
      nonsense, of virtue and vice, of aspiration and<br /> revenge, of liberty
      and tyranny.<br /> <br /> I have never said anything against Solomon's<br />
      Song. I like it better than I do any book that pre-<br /> cedes it, because
      it touches upon the human. In the<br /> desert of murder, wars of
      extermination, polygamy,<br /> concubinage and slavery, it is an oasis
      where the<br /> trees grow, where the birds sing, and where human<br /> love
      blossoms and fills the air with perfume. I do<br /> not regard that book as
      obscene. There are many<br /> things in it that are beautiful and tender,
      and it is<br /> calculated to do good rather than harm.<br /> <br /> Neither
      have I any objection to the book of Eccle-<br /> siastes&mdash;except a few
      interpolations in it. That book<br /> was written by a Freethinker, by a
      philosopher.<br /> There is not the slightest mention of God in it, nor<br />
      of another state of existence. All portions in which<br /> <br /> 197<br />
      <br /> God is mentioned are interpolations. With some of<br /> this book I
      agree heartily. I believe in the doctrine<br /> of enjoying yourself, if
      you can, to-day. I think it<br /> foolish to spend all your years in
      heaping up treas-<br /> ures, not knowing but he who will spend them is to<br />
      be an idiot. I believe it is far better to be happy with<br /> your wife
      and child now, than to be miserable here,<br /> with angelic expectations
      in some other world.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage is mistaken when he supposes
      that all<br /> Bible believers have good homes, that all Bible readers<br />
      are kind in their families. As a matter of fact, nearly all<br /> the
      wife-whippers of the United States are orthodox.<br /> Nine-tenths of the
      people in the penitentiaries are<br /> believers. Scotland is one of the
      most orthodox<br /> countries in the world, and one of the most intem-<br />
      perate. Hundreds and hundreds of women are<br /> arrested every year in
      Glasgow for drunkenness.<br /> Visit the Christian homes in the
      manufacturing dis-<br /> tricts of England. Talk with the beaters of
      children<br /> and whippers of wives, and you will find them be-<br />
      lievers. Go into what is known as the "Black<br /> "Country," and you will
      have an idea of the Chris-<br /> tian civilization of England.<br /> <br />
      Let me tell you something about the "Black<br /> "Country." There women
      work in iron; there women<br /> <br /> 198<br /> <br /> do the work of men.
      Let me give you an instance:<br /> A commission was appointed by Parliament
      to ex-<br /> amine into the condition of the women in the "Black<br />
      "Country," and a report was made. In that report<br /> I read the
      following:<br /> <br /> "A superintendent of a brickyard where women<br />
      "were engaged in carrying bricks from the yard to<br /> "the kiln, said to
      one of the women:<br /> <br /> "'Eliza, you don't appear to be very uppish
      this<br /> "morning.'"<br /> <br /> "'Neither would you be very uppish, sir,'
      she re-<br /> "plied, 'if you had had a child last night.'"<br /> <br /> This
      gives you an idea of the Christian civilization<br /> of England.<br />
      <br /> England and Ireland produce most of the prize-<br /> fighters. The
      scientific burglar is a product of Great<br /> Britain. There is not the
      great difference that Mr.<br /> Talmage supposes, between the morality of
      Pekin<br /> and of New York. I doubt if there is a city in<br /> the world
      with more crime according to the population<br /> than New York, unless it
      be London, or it may be<br /> Dublin, or Brooklyn, or possibly Glasgow,
      where<br /> a man too pious to read a newspaper published on<br /> Sunday,
      stole millions from the poor.<br /> <br /> I do not believe there is a
      country in the world<br /> <br /> 199<br /> <br /> where there is more robbery
      than in Christian lands&mdash;<br /> no country where more cashiers are
      defaulters, where<br /> more presidents of banks take the money of
      depositors,<br /> where there is more adulteration of food, where<br />
      fewer ounces make a pound, where fewer inches make<br /> a yard, where
      there is more breach of trust, more<br /> respectable larceny under the
      name of embezzlement,<br /> or more slander circulated as gospel.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage insists that there are no<br />
      contradictions in the Bible&mdash;that it is a perfect har-<br /> mony from
      Genesis to Revelation&mdash;a harmony as<br /> perfect as any piece of
      music ever written by<br /> Beethoven or Handel?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Of course, if God wrote it, the Bible<br /> ought to be perfect. I do not
      see why a minister<br /> should be so perfectly astonished to find that an<br />
      inspired book is consistent with itself throughout.<br /> Yet the truth is,
      the Bible is infinitely inconsistent.<br /> <br /> Compare the two systems&mdash;the
      system of Jehovah<br /> and that of Jesus. In the Old Testament the
      doctrine<br /> of "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" was<br />
      taught. In the New Testament, "forgive your<br /> "enemies," and "pray for
      those who despitefully<br /> "use you and persecute you." In the Old
      Testament<br /> <br /> 200<br /> <br /> it is kill, burn, massacre, destroy;
      in the New forgive.<br /> The two systems are inconsistent, and one is just<br />
      about as far wrong as the other. To live for and<br /> thirst for revenge,
      to gloat over the agony of an<br /> enemy, is one extreme; to "resist not
      evil" is the<br /> other extreme; and both these extremes are equally<br />
      distant from the golden mean of justice.<br /> <br /> The four gospels do
      not even agree as to the terms<br /> of salvation. And yet, Mr. Talmage
      tells us that<br /> there are four cardinal doctrines taught in the Bible&mdash;<br />
      the goodness of God, the fall of man, the sympathetic<br /> and forgiving
      nature of the Savior, and two desti-<br /> nies&mdash;one for believers and
      the other for unbelievers.<br /> That is to say:<br /> <br /> 1. That God is
      good, holy and forgiving.<br /> <br /> 2. That man is a lost sinner.<br />
      <br /> 3. That Christ is "all sympathetic," and ready to<br /> take the
      whole world to his heart.<br /> <br /> 4. Heaven for believers and hell for
      unbelievers.<br /> <br /> <i>First</i>. I admit that the Bible says that God
      is<br /> <br /> good and holy. But this Bible also tells what God<br /> did,
      and if God did what the Bible says he did, then I<br /> insist that God is
      not good, and that he is not holy,<br /> or forgiving. According to the
      Bible, this good<br /> God believed in religious persecution; this good<br />
      <br /> 201<br /> <br /> God believed in extermination, in polygamy, in con-<br />
      cubinage, in human slavery; this good God com-<br /> manded murder and
      massacre, and this good God<br /> could only be mollified by the shedding
      of blood.<br /> This good God wanted a butcher for a priest. This<br /> good
      God wanted husbands to kill their wives&mdash;<br /> wanted fathers and
      mothers to kill their children.<br /> This good God persecuted animals on
      account of the<br /> crimes of their owners. This good God killed the<br />
      common people because the king had displeased him.<br /> This good God
      killed the babe even of the maid<br /> behind the mill, in order that he
      might get even with<br /> a king. This good God committed every possible<br />
      crime.<br /> <br /> <i>Second</i>. The statement that man is a lost sinner<br />
      is not true. There are thousands and thousands of<br /> magnificent Pagans&mdash;men
      ready to die for wife, or<br /> child, or even for friend, and the history
      of Pagan<br /> countries is filled with self-denying and heroic acts.<br />
      If man is a failure, the infinite God, if there be one,<br /> is to blame.
      Is it possible that the God of Mr. Tal-<br /> mage could not have made man
      a success? Accord-<br /> ing to the Bible, his God made man knowing that in<br />
      about fifteen hundred years he would have to drown<br /> all his
      descendants.<br /> <br /> 202<br /> <br /> Why would a good God create a man
      that he<br /> knew would be a sinner all his life, make hundreds<br /> of
      thousands of his fellow-men unhappy, and who at<br /> last would be doomed
      to an eternity of suffering?<br /> Can such a God be good? How could a
      devil have<br /> done worse?<br /> <br /> <i>Third.</i> If God is infinitely
      good, is he not fully as<br /> sympathetic as Christ? Do you have to employ<br />
      Christ to mollify a being of infinite mercy? Is Christ<br /> any more
      willing to take to his heart the whole world<br /> than his Father is?
      Personally, I have not the<br /> slightest objection in the world to
      anybody believing<br /> in an infinitely good and kind God&mdash;not the
      slightest<br /> objection to any human being worshiping an infi-<br />
      nitely tender and merciful Christ&mdash;not the slightest<br /> objection
      to people preaching about heaven, or about<br /> the glories of the future
      state&mdash;not the slightest.<br /> <br /> <i>Fourth</i>. I object to the
      doctrine of two destinies<br /> for the human race. I object to the
      infamous false-<br /> hood of eternal fire. And yet, Mr. Talmage is en-<br />
      deavoring to poison the imagination of men, women<br /> and children with
      the doctrine of an eternal hell.<br /> Here is what he preaches, taken from
      the "Constitu-<br /> "tion of the Presbyterian Church of the United<br />
      "States:"<br /> <br /> 203<br /> <br /> "By the decrees of God, for the
      manifestation of<br /> "his glory, some men and angels are predestinated<br />
      "to everlasting life, and others foreordained to ever-<br /> "lasting
      death."<br /> <br /> That is the doctrine of Mr. Talmage. He wor-<br /> ships
      a God who damns people "for the manifesta-<br /> "tion of his glory,"&mdash;a
      God who made men, knowing<br /> that they would be damned&mdash;a God who
      damns<br /> babes simply to increase his reputation with the<br /> angels.
      This is the God of Mr. Talmage. Such a<br /> God I abhor, despise and
      execrate.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What does Mr. Talmage think of man-<br />
      kind? What is his opinion of the "unconverted"?<br /> How does he regard
      the great and glorious of the<br /> earth, who have not been the victims of
      his particular<br /> superstition? What does he think of some of the<br />
      best the earth has produced?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I will tell you how
      he looks upon all<br /> such. Read this from his "Confession of Faith:"<br />
      <br /> "Our first parents, being seduced by the subtlety<br /> "of the
      tempter, sinned in eating the forbidden fruit.<br /> "By this sin, they
      fell from their original righteous-<br /> "ness and communion with God, and
      so became<br /> "dead in sin, and wholly defiled in all the faculties<br />
      <br /> 204<br /> <br /> "and parts of soul and body; and they being the<br />
      "root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was<br /> "imputed, and the
      same death in sin and corrupted<br /> "nature conveyed to all their
      posterity. From this<br /> "original corruption&mdash;whereby we are
      utterly indis-<br /> "posed, disabled, and made opposite to all good,<br />
      "and wholly inclined to all evil, do proceed all actual<br />
      "transgressions."<br /> <br /> This is Mr. Talmage's view of humanity.<br />
      <br /> Why did his God make a devil? Why did he<br /> allow the devil to
      tempt Adam and Eve? Why did<br /> he leave innocence and ignorance at the
      mercy of<br /> subtlety and wickedness? Why did he put "the<br /> "tree of
      the knowledge of good and evil" in the<br /> garden? For what reason did he
      place temptation<br /> in the way of his children? Was it kind, was it
      just,<br /> was it noble, was it worthy of a good God? No<br /> wonder
      Christ put into his prayer: "Lead us not<br /> "into temptation."<br />
      <br /> At the time God told Adam and Eve not to eat,<br /> why did he not
      tell them of the existence of Satan?<br /> Why were they not put upon their
      guard against the<br /> serpent? Why did not God make his appearance<br />
      just before the sin, instead of just after. Why did<br /> he not play the
      role of a Savior instead of that of a<br /> <br /> 205<br /> <br /> detective?
      After he found that Adam and Eve had<br /> sinned&mdash;knowing as he did
      that they were then<br /> totally corrupt&mdash;knowing that all their
      children<br /> would be corrupt, knowing that in fifteen hundred<br /> years
      he would have to drown millions of them, why<br /> did he not allow Adam
      and Eve to perish in accord-<br /> ance with natural law, then kill the
      devil, and make a<br /> new pair?<br /> <br /> When the flood came, why did
      he not drown all?<br /> Why did he save for seed that which was "perfectly<br />
      "and thoroughly corrupt in all its parts and facul-<br /> "ties"? If God
      had drowned Noah and his sons<br /> and their families, he could have then
      made a new<br /> pair, and peopled the world with men not "wholly<br />
      "defiled in all their faculties and parts of soul and<br /> "body."<br />
      <br /> Jehovah learned nothing by experience. He per-<br /> sisted in his
      original mistake. What would we think<br /> of a man who finding that a
      field of wheat was<br /> worthless, and that such wheat never could be<br />
      raised with profit, should burn all of the field with the<br /> exception
      of a few sheaves, which he saved for seed?<br /> Why save such seed? Why
      should God have pre-<br /> served Noah, knowing that he was totally
      corrupt,<br /> and that he would again fill the world with infamous<br />
      <br /> 206<br /> <br /> people&mdash;people incapable of a good action? He<br />
      must have known at that time, that by preserving<br /> Noah, the Canaanites
      would be produced, that these<br /> same Canaanites would have to be
      murdered, that<br /> the babes in the cradles would have to be strangled.<br />
      Why did he produce them? He knew at that time,<br /> that Egypt would
      result from the salvation of Noah,<br /> that the Egyptians would have to
      be nearly de-<br /> stroyed, that he would have to kill their first-born,<br />
      that he would have to visit even their cattle with<br /> disease and
      hailstones. He knew also that the<br /> Egyptians would oppress his chosen
      people for two<br /> hundred and fifteen years, that they would upon the<br />
      back of toil inflict the lash. Why did he preserve<br /> Noah? He should
      have drowned all, and started<br /> with a new pair. He should have warned
      them<br /> against the devil, and he might have succeeded, in<br /> that
      way, in covering the world with gentlemen and<br /> ladies, with real men
      and real women.<br /> <br /> We know that most of the people now in the<br />
      world are not Christians. Most who have heard the<br /> gospel of Christ
      have rejected it, and the Presby-<br /> terian Church tells us what is to
      become of all these<br /> people. This is the "glad tidings of great joy."<br />
      Let us see:<br /> <br /> 207<br /> <br /> "All mankind, by their fall, lost
      communion with<br /> "God, are under his wrath and curse, and so made<br />
      "liable to all the miseries of this life, to death itself,<br /> "and to
      the pains of hell forever."<br /> <br /> According to this good Presbyterian
      doctrine, all<br /> that we suffer in this world, is the result of Adam's<br />
      fall. The babes of to-day suffer for the crime of the<br /> first parents.
      Not only so; but God is angry at us<br /> for what Adam did. We are under
      the wrath of an<br /> infinite God, whose brows are corrugated with eternal<br />
      hatred.<br /> <br /> Why should God hate us for being what we are<br /> and
      necessarily must have been? A being that God<br /> made&mdash;the devil&mdash;for
      whose work God is responsible,<br /> according to the Bible wrought this
      woe. God of his<br /> own free will must have made the devil. What did<br />
      he make him for? Was it necessary to have a devil<br /> in heaven? God,
      having infinite power, can of<br /> course destroy this devil to-day. Why
      does he per-<br /> mit him to live? Why did he allow him to thwart his<br />
      plans? Why did he permit him to pollute the inno-<br /> cence of Eden? Why
      does he allow him now to<br /> wrest souls by the million from the
      redeeming hand<br /> of Christ?<br /> <br /> According to the Scriptures, the
      devil has always<br /> <br /> 208<br /> <br /> been successful. He enjoys
      himself. He is called<br /> "the prince of the power of the air." He has no<br />
      conscientious scruples. He has miraculous power.<br /> All miraculous power
      must come of God, otherwise<br /> it is simply in accordance with nature.
      If the devil<br /> can work a miracle, it is only with the consent and<br />
      by the assistance of the Almighty. Is the God of<br /> Mr. Talmage in
      partnership with the devil? Do<br /> they divide profits?<br /> <br /> We are
      also told by the Presbyterian Church&mdash;<br /> I quote from their
      Confession of Faith&mdash;that "there<br /> "is no sin so small but it
      deserves damnation.'' Yet<br /> Mr. Talmage tells us that God is good, that
      he is filled<br /> with mercy and loving-kindness. A child nine or ten<br />
      years of age commits a sin, and thereupon it deserves<br /> eternal
      damnation. That is what Mr. Talmage calls,<br /> not simply justice, but
      mercy; and the sympathetic<br /> heart of Christ is not touched. The same
      being who<br /> said: "Suffer little children to come unto me," tells<br />
      us that a child, for the smallest sin, deserves to be<br /> eternally
      damned. The Presbyterian Church tells us<br /> that infants, as well as
      adults, in order to be saved,<br /> need redemption by the blood of Christ,
      and regen-<br /> eration by the Holy Ghost.<br /> <br /> I am charged with
      trying to take the consolation<br /> <br /> 209<br /> <br /> of this doctrine
      from the world. I am a criminal<br /> because I am endeavoring to convince
      the mother<br /> that her child does not deserve eternal punishment.<br /> I
      stand by the graves of those who "died in their<br /> "sins," by the tombs
      of the "unregenerate," over the<br /> ashes of men who have spent their
      lives working for<br /> their wives and children, and over the sacred dust
      of<br /> soldiers who died in defence of flag and country,<br /> and I say
      to their friends&mdash;I say to the living who<br /> loved them, I say to
      the men and women for whom<br /> they worked, I say to the children whom
      they edu-<br /> cated, I say to the country for which they died:<br /> These
      fathers, these mothers, these wives, these<br /> husbands, these soldiers
      are not in hell.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Mr. Talmage insists that the
      Bible is<br /> scientific, and that the real scientific man sees no<br />
      contradiction between revelation and science; that,<br /> on the contrary,
      they are in harmony. What is your<br /> understanding of this matter?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I do not believe the Bible to be a sci-<br /> entific
      book. In fact, most of the ministers now admit<br /> that it was not
      written to teach any science. They<br /> admit that the first chapter of
      Genesis is not geo-<br /> logically true. They admit that Joshua knew
      nothing<br /> <br /> 210<br /> <br /> of science. They admit that four-footed
      birds did<br /> not exist in the days of Moses. In fact, the only<br /> way
      they can avoid the unscientific statements of the<br /> Bible, is to assert
      that the writers simply used the<br /> common language of their day, and
      used it, not with<br /> the intention of teaching any scientific truth, but
      for<br /> the purpose of teaching some moral truth. As a<br /> matter of
      fact, we find that moral truths have been<br /> taught in all parts of this
      world. They were taught<br /> in India long before Moses lived; in Egypt
      long be-<br /> fore Abraham was born; in China thousands of<br /> years
      before the flood. They were taught by hundreds<br /> and thousands and
      millions before the Garden of<br /> Eden was planted.<br /> <br /> It would
      be impossible to prove the truth of a<br /> revelation simply because it
      contained moral truths.<br /> If it taught immorality, it would be
      absolutely certain<br /> that it was not a revelation from an infinitely
      good<br /> being. If it taught morality, it would be no reason<br /> for
      even suspecting that it had a divine origin. But<br /> if the Bible had
      given us scientific truths; if the<br /> ignorant Jews had given us the
      true theory of our<br /> solar system; if from Moses we had learned the<br />
      nature of light and heat; if from Joshua we had<br /> learned something of
      electricity; if the minor pro-<br /> <br /> 211<br /> <br /> phets had given
      us the distances to other planets;<br /> if the orbits of the stars had
      been marked by the<br /> barbarians of that day, we might have admitted
      that<br /> they must have been inspired. If they had said any-<br /> thing
      in advance of their day; if they had plucked<br /> from the night of
      ignorance one star of truth, we<br /> might have admitted the claim of
      inspiration; but<br /> the Scriptures did not rise above their source, did<br />
      not rise above their ignorant authors&mdash;above the<br /> people who
      believed in wars of extermination, in<br /> polygamy, in concubinage, in
      slavery, and who taught<br /> these things in their "sacred Scriptures."<br />
      <br /> The greatest men in the scientific world have not<br /> been, and are
      not, believers in the inspiration of the<br /> Scriptures. There has been
      no greater astronomer<br /> than Laplace. There is no greater name than<br />
      Humboldt. There is no living scientist who stands<br /> higher than Charles
      Darwin. All the professors in<br /> all the religious colleges in this
      country rolled into<br /> one, would not equal Charles Darwin. All the cow-<br />
      ardly apologists for the cosmogony of Moses do not<br /> amount to as much
      in the world of thought as Ernst<br /> Haeckel. There is no orthodox
      scientist the equal<br /> of Tyndall or Huxley. There is not one in this<br />
      country the equal of John Fiske. I insist, that the<br /> <br /> 212<br />
      <br /> foremost men to-day in the scientific world reject the<br /> dogma of
      inspiration. They reject the science of the<br /> Bible, and hold in utter
      contempt the astronomy of<br /> Joshua, and the geology of Moses.<br />
      <br /> Mr. Talmage tells us "that Science is a boy and<br /> "Revelation is
      a man." Of course, like the most he<br /> says, it is substantially the
      other way. Revelation,<br /> so-called, was the boy. Religion was the
      lullaby of<br /> the cradle, the ghost-story told by the old woman,<br />
      Superstition. Science is the man. Science asks for<br /> demonstration.
      Science impels us to investigation,<br /> and to verify everything for
      ourselves. Most pro-<br /> fessors of American colleges, if they were not
      afraid<br /> of losing their places, if they did not know that<br />
      Christians were bad enough now to take the bread<br /> from their mouths,
      would tell their students that the<br /> Bible is not a scientific book.<br />
      <br /> I admit that I have said:<br /> <br /> 1. That the Bible is cruel.<br />
      <br /> 2. That in many passages it is impure.<br /> <br /> 3. That it is
      contradictory.<br /> <br /> 4. That it is unscientific.<br /> <br /> Let me
      now prove these propositions one by one.<br /> <br /> First. The Bible is
      cruel.<br /> <br /> I have opened it at random, and the very first<br />
      <br /> 213<br /> <br /> chapter that has struck my eye is the sixth of First<br />
      Samuel. In the nineteenth verse of that chapter, I<br /> find the
      following:<br /> <br /> "And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because<br />
      "they had looked into the ark of the Lord; even he<br /> "smote of the
      people fifty thousand and three-score<br /> "and ten men."<br /> <br /> All
      this slaughter was because some people had<br /> looked into a box that was
      carried upon a cart. Was<br /> that cruel?<br /> <br /> I find, also, in the
      twenty-fourth chapter of Second<br /> Samuel, that David was moved by God
      to number<br /> Israel and Judah. God put it into his heart to take<br /> a
      census of his people, and thereupon David said to<br /> Joab, the captain
      of his host:<br /> <br /> "Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from<br />
      "Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people,<br /> "that I may know
      the number of the people."<br /> <br /> At the end of nine months and twenty
      days, Joab<br /> gave the number of the people to the king, and<br /> there
      were at that time, according to that census,<br /> "eight hundred thousand
      valiant men that drew the<br /> "sword," in Israel, and in Judah, "five
      hundred<br /> "thousand men," making a total of thirteen hundred<br />
      thousand men of war. The moment this census was<br /> <br /> 214<br /> <br />
      taken, the wrath of the Lord waxed hot against<br /> David, and thereupon
      he sent a seer, by the name of<br /> Gad, to David, and asked him to choose
      whether he<br /> would have seven years of famine, or fly three<br /> months
      before his enemies, or have three days of<br /> pestilence. David concluded
      that as God was so<br /> merciful as to give him a choice, he would be more<br />
      merciful than man, and he chose the pestilence.<br /> <br /> Now, it must be
      remembered that the sin of taking<br /> the census had not been committed
      by the people,<br /> but by David himself, inspired by God, yet the<br />
      people were to be punished for David's sin. So,,<br /> when David chose the
      pestilence, God immediately<br /> killed "seventy thousand men, from Dan
      even to<br /> "Beersheba."<br /> <br /> "And when the angel stretched out his
      hand upon<br /> "Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord repented him of<br />
      "the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the<br /> "people, It is
      enough; stay now thine hand."<br /> <br /> Was this cruel?<br /> <br /> Why
      did a God of infinite mercy destroy seventy<br /> thousand men? Why did he
      fill his land with widows<br /> and orphans, because King David had taken
      the cen-<br /> sus? If he wanted to kill anybody, why did he not<br /> kill
      David? I will tell you why. Because at that<br /> <br /> 215<br /> <br />
      time, the people were considered as the property of<br /> the king. He
      killed the people precisely as he killed<br /> the cattle. And yet, I am
      told that the Bible is not a<br /> cruel book.<br /> <br /> In the
      twenty-first chapter of Second Samuel, I<br /> find that there were three
      years of famine in the days<br /> of David, and that David inquired of the
      Lord the<br /> reason of the famine; and the Lord told him that it<br /> was
      because Saul had slain the Gibeonites. Why did<br /> not God punish Saul
      instead of the people? And<br /> David asked the Gibeonites how he should
      make<br /> atonement, and the Gibeonites replied that they<br /> wanted no
      silver nor gold, but they asked that seven<br /> of the sons of Saul might
      be delivered unto them, so<br /> that they could hang them before the Lord,
      in Gibeah.<br /> And David agreed to the proposition, and thereupon<br /> he
      delivered to the Gibeonites the two sons of Rizpah,<br /> Saul's concubine,
      and the five sons of Michal, the<br /> daughter of Saul, and the Gibeonites
      hanged all<br /> seven of them together. And Rizpah, more tender<br /> than
      them all, with a woman's heart of love kept<br /> lonely vigil by the dead,
      "from the beginning of har-<br /> "vest until water dropped upon them out
      of heaven,<br /> "and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest upon<br />
      "them by day, nor the beast of the field by night."<br /> <br /> 216<br />
      <br /> I want to know if the following, from the fifteenth<br /> chapter of
      First Samuel, is inspired:<br /> <br /> "Thus saith the Lord of hosts; I
      remember that<br /> "which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for<br />
      "him in the way when he came up from Egypt. Now<br /> "go and smite Amalek,
      and utterly destroy all that<br /> "they have, and spare them not, but slay
      both man<br /> "and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep,<br /> "camel
      and ass."<br /> <br /> We must remember that those he was commanded<br /> to
      slay had done nothing to Israel. It was something<br /> done by their
      forefathers, hundreds of years before;<br /> and yet they are commanded to
      slay the women and<br /> children and even the animals, and to spare none.<br />
      <br /> It seems that Saul only partially carried into exe-<br /> cution this
      merciful command of Jehovah. He spared<br /> the life of the king. He
      "utterly destroyed all the<br /> "people with the edge of the sword," but
      he kept<br /> alive the best of the sheep and oxen and of the fat-<br />
      lings and lambs. Then God spake unto Samuel and<br /> told him that he was
      very sorry he had made Saul<br /> king, because he had not killed all the
      animals, and<br /> because he had spared Agag; and Samuel asked<br /> Saul:
      "What meaneth this bleating of sheep in mine<br /> "ears, and the lowing of
      the oxen which I hear?"<br /> <br /> 217<br /> <br /> Are stories like this
      calculated to make soldiers<br /> merciful?<br /> <br /> So I read in the
      sixth chapter of Joshua, the fate<br /> of the city of Jericho: "And they
      utterly destroyed<br /> "all that was in the city, both man and woman,<br />
      "young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the<br /> "edge of the
      sword. And they burnt the city with<br /> "fire, and all that was therein."
      But we are told that<br /> one family was saved by Joshua, out of the
      general<br /> destruction: "And Joshua saved Rahab, the harlot,<br />
      "alive, and her father's household, and all that she<br /> "had." Was this
      fearful destruction an act of<br /> mercy?<br /> <br /> It seems that they
      saved the money of their<br /> victims: "the silver and gold and the
      vessels of brass<br /> "and of iron they put into the treasury of the house<br />
      "of the Lord."<br /> <br /> After all this pillage and carnage, it appears<br />
      that there was a suspicion in Joshua's mind that<br /> somebody was keeping
      back a part of the treasure.<br /> Search was made, and a man by the name
      of Achan<br /> admitted that he had sinned against the Lord, that he<br />
      had seen a Babylonish garment among the spoils, and<br /> two hundred
      shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of<br /> fifty shekels' weight, and
      that he took them and hid<br /> <br /> 2l8<br /> <br /> them in his tent. For
      this atrocious crime it seems<br /> that the Lord denied any victories to
      the Jews until<br /> they found out the wicked criminal. When they dis-<br />
      covered poor Achan, "they took him and his sons<br /> "and his daughters,
      and his oxen and his asses and<br /> "his sheep, and all that he had, and
      brought them unto<br /> "the valley of Achor; and all Israel stoned him
      with<br /> "stones and burned them with fire after they had<br /> "stoned
      them with stones."<br /> <br /> After Achan and his sons and his daughters
      and<br /> his herds had been stoned and burned to death, we<br /> are told
      that "the Lord turned from the fierceness of<br /> "his anger."<br /> <br />
      And yet it is insisted that this God "is merciful,<br /> "and that his
      loving-kindness is over all his works."<br /> In the eighth chapter of this
      same book, the infi-<br /> nite God, "creator of heaven and earth and all
      that is<br /> "therein," told his general, Joshua, to lay an ambush<br />
      for a city&mdash;to "lie in wait against the city, even be-<br /> "hind the
      city; go not very far from the city, but be<br /> "ye all ready." He told
      him to make an attack and<br /> then to run, as though he had been beaten,
      in order<br /> that the inhabitants of the city might follow, and<br />
      thereupon his reserves that he had ambushed might<br /> rush into the city
      and set it on fire. God Almighty<br /> <br /> 219<br /> <br /> planned the
      battle. God himself laid the snare. The<br /> whole programme was carried
      out. Joshua made<br /> believe that he was beaten, and fled, and then the<br />
      soldiers in ambush rose out of their places, enter-<br /> ed the city, and
      set it on fire. Then came the<br /> slaughter. They "utterly destroyed all
      the inhabit-<br /> "ants of Ai," men and maidens, women and babes,<br />
      sparing only their king till evening, when they<br /> hanged him on a tree,
      then "took his carcase down<br /> "from the tree and cast it at the
      entering of the<br /> "gate, and raised thereon a great heap of stones<br />
      "which remaineth unto this day." After having<br /> done all this, "Joshua
      built an altar unto the Lord<br /> "God of Israel, and offered burnt
      offerings unto the<br /> "Lord." I ask again, was this cruel?<br /> <br />
      Again I ask, was the treatment of the Gibeonites<br /> cruel when they
      sought to make peace but were<br /> denied, and cursed instead; and
      although permitted<br /> to live, were yet made slaves? Read the mandate<br />
      consigning them to bondage: "Now therefore ye<br /> "are cursed, and there
      shall none of you be freed<br /> "from being bondmen and hewers of wood and<br />
      "drawers of water for the house of my God."<br /> <br /> Is it possible, as
      recorded in the tenth chapter of<br /> Joshua, that the Lord took part in
      these battles, and<br /> <br /> 220<br /> <br /> cast down great hail-stones
      from the battlements of<br /> heaven upon the enemies of the Israelites, so
      that<br /> "they were more who died with hail-stones, than<br /> "they whom
      the children of Israel slew with the<br /> "sword"?<br /> <br /> Is it
      possible that a being of infinite power would<br /> exercise it in that way
      instead of in the interest of<br /> kindness and peace?<br /> <br /> I find,
      also, in this same chapter, that Joshua took<br /> Makkedah and smote it
      with the edge of the sword,<br /> that he utterly destroyed all the souls
      that were<br /> therein, that he allowed none to remain.<br /> <br /> I find
      that he fought against Libnah, and smote<br /> it with the edge of the
      sword, and utterly destroyed<br /> all the souls that were therein, and
      allowed none to<br /> remain, and did unto the king as he did unto the king<br />
      of Jericho.<br /> <br /> I find that he also encamped against Lachish, and<br />
      that God gave him that city, and that he "smote it<br /> "with the edge of
      the sword, and all the souls that<br /> "were therein," sparing neither old
      nor young, help-<br /> less women nor prattling babes.<br /> <br /> He also
      vanquished Horam, King of Gezer, "and<br /> "smote him and his people until
      he left him none<br /> "remaining."<br /> <br /> 221<br /> <br /> He encamped
      against the city of Eglon, and killed<br /> every soul that was in it, at
      the edge of the sword,<br /> just as he had done to Lachish and all the
      others.<br /> <br /> He fought against Hebron, "and took it and<br /> "smote
      it with the edge of the sword, and the king<br /> "thereof,"&mdash;and it
      appears that several cities, their<br /> number not named, were included in
      this slaughter,<br /> for Hebron "and all the cities thereof and all the<br />
      "souls that were therein," were utterly destroyed.<br /> <br /> He then
      waged war against Debir and took it, and<br /> more unnumbered cities with
      it, and all the souls that<br /> were therein shared the same horrible fate&mdash;he
      did<br /> not leave a soul alive.<br /> <br /> And this chapter of horrors
      concludes with this<br /> song of victory:<br /> <br /> "So Joshua smote all
      the country of the hills, and<br /> "of the south, and of the vale, and of
      the springs,<br /> "and all their kings: he left none remaining, but<br />
      "utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord<br /> "God of Israel
      commanded. And Joshua smote<br /> "them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza,
      and all the<br /> "country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. And all these<br />
      "kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,<br /> "because the Lord
      God of Israel fought for Israel."<br /> Was God, at that time, merciful?<br />
      <br /> 222<br /> <br /> I find, also, in the twenty-first chapter that many<br />
      Icings met, with their armies, for the purpose of<br /> overwhelming
      Israel, and the Lord said unto Joshua:<br /> "Be not afraid because of
      them, for to-morrow about<br /> "this time I will deliver them all slain
      before Israel.<br /> "I will hough their horses and burn their chariots<br />
      "with fire." Were animals so treated by the com-<br /> mand of a merciful
      God?<br /> <br /> Joshua captured Razor, and smote all the souls<br /> that
      were therein with the edge of the sword, there<br /> was not one left to
      breathe; and he took all the<br /> cities of all the kings that took up
      arms against him,<br /> and utterly destroyed all the inhabitants thereof.<br />
      He took the cattle and spoils as prey unto himself,<br /> and smote every
      man with the edge of the sword;<br /> and not only so, but left not a human
      being to<br /> breathe.<br /> <br /> I find the following directions given to
      the Israel-<br /> ites who were waging a war of conquest. They are<br /> in
      the twentieth chapter of Deuteronomy, from the<br /> tenth to the
      eighteenth verses:<br /> <br /> "When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight<br />
      "against it, then proclaim peace unto it. And it<br /> "shall be, if it
      make thee an answer of peace, and<br /> "open unto thee, then it shall be
      that all the people<br /> <br /> 223<br /> <br /> "that is found therein shall
      be tributaries unto thee,<br /> "and they shall serve thee. And if it will
      make no<br /> "peace with thee, but will war against thee, then<br /> "thou
      shalt besiege it. And when the Lord thy<br /> "God hath delivered it into
      thine hands, thou shalt<br /> "smite every male thereof with the edge of
      the<br /> "sword; but the women, and the little ones, and<br /> "the cattle,
      and all that is in the city, even the spoil<br /> "thereof, shalt thou take
      unto thyself; and thou<br /> "shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which
      the<br /> "Lord thy God hath given thee. Thus shalt thou<br /> "do unto all
      the cities which are very far off from<br /> "thee, which are not of the
      cities of these nations."<br /> It will be seen from this that people could
      take<br /> their choice between death and slavery, provided<br /> these
      people lived a good ways from the Israelites.<br /> Now, let us see how
      they were to treat the inhabit-<br /> ants of the cities near to them:<br />
      <br /> "But of the cities of these people which the Lord<br /> "thy God doth
      give thee for an inheritance, thou<br /> "shalt save alive nothing that
      breatheth. But thou<br /> "shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the
      Hittites,<br /> "and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites,<br />
      "the Hivites and the Jebusites, as the Lord thy God<br /> "hath commanded
      thee."<br /> <br /> 224<br /> <br /> It never occurred to this merciful God to
      send<br /> missionaries to these people. He built them no<br />
      schoolhouses, taught them no alphabet, gave them<br /> no book; they were
      not supplied even with a copy of<br /> the Ten Commandments. He did not say
      "Reform,"<br /> but "Kill;" not "Educate," but "Destroy." He gave<br /> them
      no Bible, built them no church, sent them no<br /> preachers. He knew when
      he made them that he<br /> would have to have them murdered. When he<br />
      created them he knew that they were not fit to live;<br /> and yet, this is
      the infinite God who is infinitely<br /> merciful and loves his children
      better than an earthly<br /> mother loves her babe.<br /> <br /> In order to
      find just how merciful God is, read the<br /> twenty-eighth chapter of
      Deuteronomy, and see what<br /> he promises to do with people who do not
      keep all of<br /> his commandments and all of his statutes. He curses<br />
      them in their basket and store, in the fruit of their<br /> body, in the
      fruit of their land, in the increase of their<br /> cattle and sheep. He
      curses them in the city and in<br /> the field, in their coming in and
      their going out. He<br /> curses them with pestilence, with consumption,
      with<br /> fever, with inflammation, with extreme burning, with<br /> sword,
      with blasting, with mildew. He tells them<br /> that the heavens shall be
      as brass over their heads<br /> <br /> 225<br /> <br /> and the earth as iron
      under their feet; that the rain<br /> shall be powder and dust and shall
      come down on<br /> them and destroy them; that they shall flee seven<br />
      ways before their enemies; that their carcasses shall<br /> be meat for the
      fowls of the air, and the beasts of the<br /> earth; that he will smite
      them with the botch of<br /> Egypt, and with the scab, and with the itch,
      and with<br /> madness and blindness and astonishment; that he<br /> will
      make them grope at noonday; that they shall be<br /> oppressed and spoiled
      evermore; that one shall be-<br /> troth a wife and another shall have her;
      that they<br /> shall build a house and not dwell in it; plant a vine-<br />
      yard and others shall eat the grapes; that their<br /> sons and daughters
      shall be given to their enemies;<br /> that he will make them mad for the
      sight of their<br /> eyes; that he will smite them in the knees and in the<br />
      legs with a sore botch that cannot be healed, and<br /> from the sole of
      the foot to the top of the head;<br /> that they shall be a by-word among
      all nations; that<br /> they shall sow much seed and gather but little;
      that<br /> the locusts shall consume their crops; that they shall<br />
      plant vineyards and drink no wine,&mdash;that they shall<br /> gather
      grapes, but worms shall eat them; that they<br /> shall raise olives but
      have no oil; beget sons and<br /> daughters, but they shall go into
      captivity; that all<br /> <br /> 226<br /> <br /> the trees and fruit of the
      land shall be devoured by<br /> locusts, and that all these curses shall
      pursue them<br /> and overtake them, until they be destroyed; that they<br />
      shall be slaves to their enemies, and be constantly in<br /> hunger and
      thirst and nakedness, and in want of all<br /> things. And as though this
      were not enough, the<br /> Lord tells them that he will bring a nation
      against<br /> them swift as eagles, a nation fierce and savage, that<br />
      will show no mercy and no favor to old or young,<br /> and leave them
      neither corn, nor wine, nor oil, nor<br /> flocks, nor herds; and this
      nation shall besiege them<br /> in their cities until they are reduced to
      the necessity<br /> of eating the flesh of their own sons and daughters;<br />
      so that the men would eat their wives and their<br /> children, and women
      eat their husbands and their<br /> own sons and daughters, and their own
      babes.<br /> <br /> All these curses God pronounced upon them if they<br />
      did not observe to do all the words of the law that<br /> were written in
      his book.<br /> <br /> This same merciful God threatened that he would<br />
      bring upon them all the diseases of Egypt&mdash;every<br /> sickness and
      every plague; that he would scatter<br /> them from one end of the earth to
      the other; that<br /> they should find no rest; that their lives should
      hang<br /> in perpetual doubt; that in the morning they would<br /> <br />
      227<br /> <br /> say: Would God it were evening! and in the even-<br /> ing,
      Would God it were morning! and that he would<br /> finally take them back
      to Egypt where they should<br /> be again sold for bondmen and bondwomen.<br />
      <br /> This curse, the foundation of the <i>Anathema<br /> maranatha</i>;
      this curse, used by the pope of Rome to<br /> prevent the spread of
      thought; this curse used even<br /> by the Protestant Church; this curse
      born of barba-<br /> rism and of infinite cruelty, is now said to have<br />
      issued from the lips of an infinitely merciful God. One<br /> would suppose
      that Jehovah had gone insane; that<br /> he had divided his kingdom like
      Lear, and from the<br /> darkness of insanity had launched his curses upon
      a<br /> world.<br /> <br /> In order that there may be no doubt as to the<br />
      mercy of Jehovah, read the thirteenth chapter of<br /> Deuteronomy:<br />
      <br /> "If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy<br /> "son, or thy
      daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or<br /> "thy friend, which is as thine
      own soul, entice thee<br /> "secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other
      gods,<br /> "which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers;<br /> " * * *
      thou shalt not consent unto him, nor<br /> "hearken unto him; neither shall
      thine eyes pity him,<br /> "neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou
      conceal<br /> <br /> 228<br /> <br /> "him; but thou shalt surely kill him:
      thine hand<br /> "shall be first upon him to put him to death, and<br />
      "afterwards the hand of all the people; and thou<br /> "shalt stone him
      with stones that he die, because he<br /> "hath sought to entice thee away
      from the Lord thy<br /> "God."<br /> <br /> This, according to Mr. Talmage,
      is a commandment<br /> of the infinite God. According to him, God ordered<br />
      a man to murder his own son, his own wife, his own<br /> brother, his own
      daughter, if they dared even to sug-<br /> gest the worship of some other
      God than Jehovah.<br /> For my part, it is impossible not to despise such<br />
      a God&mdash;a God not willing that one should worship<br /> what he must.
      No one can control his admiration,<br /> and if a savage at sunrise falls
      upon his knees and<br /> offers homage to the great light of the East, he
      can-<br /> not help it. If he worships the moon, he cannot help<br /> it. If
      he worships fire, it is because he cannot control<br /> his own spirit. A
      picture is beautiful to me in spite<br /> of myself. A statue compels the
      applause of my<br /> brain. The worship of the sun was an exceedingly<br />
      natural religion, and why should a man or woman be<br /> destroyed for
      kneeling at the fireside of the world?<br /> <br /> No wonder that this same
      God, in the very next<br /> chapter of Deuteronomy to that quoted, says to
      his<br /> <br /> 229<br /> <br /> chosen people: "Ye shall not eat of anything
      that<br /> "dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger<br />
      "that is within thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou<br /> "mayest sell
      it unto an alien: for thou art a holy<br /> "people unto the Lord thy God."<br />
      <br /> What a mingling of heartlessness and thrift&mdash;the<br /> religion
      of sword and trade!<br /> <br /> In the seventh chapter of Deuteronomy,
      Jehovah<br /> gives his own character. He tells the Israelites that<br />
      there are seven nations greater and mightier than<br /> themselves, but
      that he will deliver them to his chosen<br /> people, and that they shall
      smite them and utterly<br /> destroy them; and having some fear that a drop
      of<br /> pity might remain in the Jewish heart, he says:<br /> <br /> "Thou
      shalt make no covenant with them, nor<br /> "show mercy unto them. * * *
      Know therefore<br /> "that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God,<br />
      "which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that<br /> "love him and keep
      his commandments to a thousand<br /> "generations, and repayeth them that
      hate him to<br /> "their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to<br />
      "him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face."<br /> This is the
      description which the merciful, long-suffer-<br /> ing Jehovah gives of
      himself.<br /> <br /> So, he promises great prosperity to the Jews if<br />
      <br /> 230<br /> <br /> they will only obey his commandments, and says:<br />
      "And the Lord will take away from thee all sickness,<br /> "and will put
      none of the evil diseases of Egypt<br /> "upon thee, but will lay them upon
      all them that<br /> "hate thee. And thou shalt consume all the people<br />
      "which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee; thine<br /> "eye shall have no
      pity upon them."<br /> <br /> Under the immediate government of Jehovah,<br />
      mercy was a crime. According to the law of God,<br /> pity was weakness,
      tenderness was treason, kindness<br /> was blasphemy, while hatred and
      massacre were<br /> virtues.<br /> <br /> In the second chapter of
      Deuteronomy we find<br /> another account tending to prove that Jehovah is
      a<br /> merciful God. We find that Sihon, king of Heshbon,<br /> would not
      let the Hebrews pass by him, and the<br /> reason given is, that "the Lord
      God hardened his<br /> "spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might<br />
      "deliver him into the hand" of the Hebrews. Sihon,<br /> his heart having
      been hardened by God, came out<br /> against the chosen people, and God
      delivered him to<br /> them, and "they smote him, and his sons, and all his<br />
      "people, and took all his cities, and utterly destroyed<br /> "the men and
      the women, and the little ones of<br /> "every city: they left none to
      remain." And in this<br /> <br /> 231<br /> <br /> same chapter this same God
      promises that the dread<br /> and fear of his chosen people should be "upon
      all the<br /> "nations that are under the whole heaven," and that<br />
      "they should "tremble and be in anguish because of"<br /> the Hebrews.<br />
      <br /> Read the thirty-first chapter of Numbers, and see<br /> how the
      Midianites were slain. You will find that<br /> "the children of Israel
      took all the women of Midian<br /> "captives, and their little ones," that
      they took "all<br /> "their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their
      goods,"<br /> that they slew all the males, and burnt all their cities<br />
      and castles with fire, that they brought the captives<br /> and the prey
      and the spoil unto Moses and Eleazar<br /> the priest; that Moses was wroth
      with the officers<br /> of his host because they had saved all the women<br />
      alive, and thereupon this order was given: "Kill<br /> "every male among
      the little ones, and kill every<br /> "woman, * * * but all the women
      children<br /> "keep alive for yourselves."<br /> <br /> After this, God
      himself spake unto Moses, and<br /> said: "Take the sum of the prey that
      was taken,<br /> "both of man and of beast, thou and Eleazar the<br />
      "priest * * * and divide the prey into two<br /> "parts, between those who
      went to war, and between<br /> "all the congregation, and levy a tribute
      unto the<br /> <br /> 232<br /> <br /> "Lord, one soul of five hundred of the
      persons,<br /> "and the cattle; take it of their half and give it to<br />
      "the priest for an offering * * * and of the<br /> "children of Israel's
      half, take one portion of fifty of<br /> "the persons and the animals and
      give them unto<br /> "the Levites. * * * And Moses and the priest<br /> "did
      as the Lord had commanded." It seems that<br /> they had taken six hundred
      and seventy-five thou-<br /> sand sheep, seventy-two thousand beeves,
      sixty-one<br /> thousand asses, and thirty-two thousand women<br /> children
      and maidens. And it seems, by the fortieth<br /> verse, <i>that the Lord's
      tribute of the maidens was thirty-<br /> two</i>,&mdash;the rest were given
      to the soldiers and to the<br /> congregation of the Lord.<br /> <br /> Was
      anything more infamous ever recorded in the<br /> annals of barbarism? And
      yet we are told that the<br /> Bible is an inspired book, that it is not a
      cruel book,<br /> and that Jehovah is a being of infinite mercy.<br /> <br />
      In the twenty-fifth chapter of Numbers we find<br /> that the Israelites
      had joined themselves unto Baal-<br /> Peor, and thereupon the anger of the
      Lord was<br /> kindled against them, as usual. No being ever lost<br /> his
      temper more frequently than this Jehovah. Upon<br /> this particular
      occasion, "the Lord said unto Moses,<br /> "Take all the heads of the
      people, and hang them<br /> <br /> 233<br /> <br /> "up before the Lord
      against the sun, that the fierce<br /> "anger of the Lord may be turned
      away from Israel."<br /> And thereupon "Moses said unto the judges of
      Israel,<br /> "Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto<br />
      "Baal-peor."<br /> <br /> Just as soon as these people were killed, and
      their<br /> heads hung up before the Lord against the sun, and<br /> a
      horrible double murder of a too merciful Israelite<br /> and a Midianitish
      woman, had been committed by<br /> Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, "the
      plague was stayed<br /> "from the children of Israel." Twenty-four thousand<br />
      had died. Thereupon, "the Lord spake unto Moses<br /> "and said"&mdash;and
      it is a very merciful commandment<br /> &mdash;"Vex the Midianites and
      smite them."<br /> <br /> In the twenty-first chapter of Numbers is more
      evi-<br /> dence that God is merciful and compassionate.<br /> <br /> The
      children of Israel had become discouraged.<br /> They had wandered so long
      in the desert that they<br /> finally cried out: "Wherefore have ye brought
      us<br /> "up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There<br /> "is no
      bread, there is no water, and our soul loatheth<br /> "this light bread."
      Of course they were hungry and<br /> thirsty. Who would not complain under
      similar cir-<br /> cumstances? And yet, on account of this complaint,<br />
      the God of infinite tenderness and compassion sent<br /> <br /> 234<br />
      <br /> serpents among them, and these serpents bit them&mdash;<br /> bit the
      cheeks of children, the breasts of maidens,<br /> and the withered faces of
      age. Why would a God<br /> do such an infamous thing? Why did he not, as
      the<br /> leader of this people, his chosen children, feed them<br />
      better? Certainly an infinite God had the power<br /> to satisfy their
      hunger and to quench their thirst.<br /> He who overwhelmed a world with
      water, certainly<br /> could have made a few brooks, cool and babbling,<br />
      to follow his chosen people through all their jour-<br /> neying. He could
      have supplied them with miracu-<br /> lous food.<br /> <br /> How fortunate
      for the Jews that Jehovah was not<br /> revengeful, that he was so slow to
      anger, so patient,<br /> so easily pleased. What would they have done had<br />
      he been exacting, easily incensed, revengeful, cruel,<br /> or
      blood-thirsty?<br /> <br /> In the sixteenth chapter of Numbers, an account
      is<br /> given of a rebellion. It seems that Korah, Dathan<br /> and Abiram
      got tired of Moses and Aaron. They<br /> thought the priests were taking a
      little too much<br /> upon themselves. So Moses told them to have two<br />
      hundred and fifty of their men bring their censers<br /> and put incense in
      them before the Lord, and stand<br /> in the door of the tabernacle of the
      congregation<br /> <br /> 235<br /> <br /> with Moses and Aaron. That being
      done, the Lord<br /> appeared, and told Moses and Aaron to separate<br />
      themselves from the people, that he might consume<br /> them all in a
      moment. Moses and Aaron, having a<br /> little compassion, begged God not
      to kill everybody.<br /> The people were then divided, and Dathan and<br />
      Abiram came out and stood in the door of their<br /> tents with their wives
      and their sons and their little<br /> children. And Moses said:<br /> <br />
      "Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent<br /> "me to do all these
      works; for I have not done them<br /> "of my mine own mind. If these men
      die the<br /> "common death of all men, or if they be visited<br /> "after
      the common visitation of all men, then the<br /> "Lord hath not sent me.
      But if the Lord make a<br /> "new thing, and the earth open her mouth and<br />
      "swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them,<br /> "and they go
      down quick into the pit, then ye shall<br /> "understand that these men
      have provoked the<br /> "Lord." The moment he ceased speaking, "the<br />
      "ground clave asunder that was under them; and<br /> "the earth opened her
      mouth and swallowed them up,<br /> "and their houses, and all the men that
      appertained<br /> "unto Korah, and all their goods. They, and all that<br />
      "appertained to them went down alive into the pit,<br /> <br /> 236<br />
      <br /> "and the earth closed upon them, and they perished<br /> "from among
      the congregation."<br /> <br /> This, according to Mr. Talmage, was the act
      of an<br /> exceedingly merciful God, prompted by infinite kind-<br /> ness,
      and moved by eternal pity. What would he<br /> have done had he acted from
      motives of revenge?<br /> What would he Jiave done had he been remorse-<br />
      lessly cruel and wicked?<br /> <br /> In addition to those swallowed by the
      earth, the<br /> two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense<br />
      were consumed by "a fire that came out from the<br /> "Lord." And not only
      this, but the same merciful<br /> Jehovah wished to consume all the people,
      and he<br /> would have consumed them all, only that Moses pre-<br /> vailed
      upon Aaron to take a censer and put fire<br /> therein from off the altar
      of incense and go quickly<br /> to the congregation and make an atonement
      for them.<br /> He was not quick enough. The plague had already<br /> begun;
      and before he could possibly get the censers<br /> and incense among the
      people, fourteen thousand and<br /> seven hundred had died of the plague.
      How many<br /> more might have died, if Jehovah had not been so<br /> slow
      to anger and so merciful and tender to his<br /> children, we have no means
      of knowing.<br /> <br /> In the thirteenth chapter of the same book of<br />
      <br /> 237<br /> <br /> Numbers, we find that some spies were sent over<br />
      into the promised land, and that they brought back<br /> grapes and figs
      and pomegranates, and reported that<br /> the whole land was flowing with
      milk and honey, but<br /> that the people were strong, that the cities were<br />
      walled, and that the nations in the promised land<br /> were mightier than
      the Hebrews. They reported that<br /> all the people they met were men of a
      great stature,<br /> that they had seen "the giants, the sons of Anak<br />
      "which come of giants," compared with whom the<br /> Israelites were "in
      their own sight as grasshoppers,<br /> "and so were we in their sight."
      Entirely discour-<br /> aged by these reports, "all the congregation lifted
      up<br /> "their voice and cried, and the people wept that<br /> "night * * *
      and murmured against Moses and<br /> "against Aaron, and said unto them:
      Would God<br /> "that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would<br /> "God
      we had died in this wilderness!" Some of<br /> them thought that it would
      be better to go back,&mdash;<br /> that they might as well be slaves in
      Egypt as to be<br /> food for giants in the promised land. They did not<br />
      want their bones crunched between the teeth of the<br /> sons of Anak.<br />
      <br /> Jehovah got angry again, and said to Moses:<br /> "How long will
      these people provoke me? * * *<br /> <br /> 238<br /> <br /> "I will smite
      them with pestilence, and disinherit<br /> "them." But Moses said: Lord, if
      you do this,<br /> the Egyptians will hear of it, and they will say that<br />
      you were not able to bring your people into the<br /> promised land. Then
      he proceeded to flatter him by<br /> telling him how merciful and
      long-suffering he had<br /> been. Finally, Jehovah concluded to pardon the<br />
      people this time, but his pardon depended upon the<br /> violation of his
      promise, for he said: "They shall<br /> "not see the land which I sware
      unto their fathers,<br /> "neither shall any of them that provoked me see
      it;<br /> "but my servant Caleb, * * * him will I bring<br /> "into the
      land." And Jehovah said to the people:<br /> "Your carcasses shall fall in
      this wilderness, and all<br /> "that were numbered of you according to your<br />
      "whole number, from twenty years old and upward,<br /> "which have murmured
      against me, ye shall not<br /> "come into the land concerning which I sware
      to<br /> "make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of<br /> "Jephunneh,
      and Joshua the son of Nun. But your<br /> "little ones, which ye said
      should be a prey, them<br /> "will I bring in, and they shall know the land<br />
      "which ye have despised. But as for you, your<br /> "carcasses shall fall
      in this wilderness. And your<br /> "children shall wander in the wilderness
      forty<br /> <br /> 239<br /> <br /> "years * * * until your carcasses be
      wasted in<br /> "the wilderness."<br /> <br /> And all this because the
      people were afraid of<br /> giants, compared with whom they were but as
      grass-<br /> hoppers.<br /> <br /> So we find that at one time the people
      became<br /> exceedingly hungry. They had no flesh to eat.<br /> There were
      six hundred thousand men of war, and<br /> they had nothing to feed on but
      manna. They<br /> naturally murmured and complained, and thereupon a<br />
      wind from the Lord went forth and brought quails<br /> from the sea,
      (quails are generally found in the sea,)<br /> "and let them fall by the
      camp, as it were a day's<br /> "journey on this side, and as it were a
      day's journey<br /> "on the other side, round about the camp, and as it<br />
      "were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.<br /> "And the people
      stood up all that day, and all that<br /> "night, and all the next day, and
      they gathered the<br /> "quails. * * * And while the flesh was yet be-<br />
      "tween their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of<br /> "the Lord was
      kindled against the people, and the<br /> "Lord smote the people with a
      very great plague."<br /> <br /> Yet he is slow to anger, long-suffering,
      merciful<br /> and just.<br /> <br /> In the thirty-second chapter of Exodus,
      is the ac-<br /> <br /> 240<br /> <br /> count of the golden calf. It must be
      borne in mind<br /> that the worship of this calf by the people was before<br />
      the Ten Commandments had been given to them.<br /> Christians now insist
      that these commandments must<br /> have been inspired, because no human
      being could<br /> have constructed them,&mdash;could have conceived of<br />
      them.<br /> <br /> It seems, according to this account, that Moses had<br />
      been up in the mount with God, getting the Ten Com-<br /> mandments, and
      that while he was there the people<br /> had made the golden calf. When he
      came down and<br /> saw them, and found what they had done, having in<br />
      his hands the two tables, the work of God, he cast<br /> the tables out of
      his hands, and broke them beneath<br /> the mount. He then took the calf
      which they had<br /> made, ground it to powder, strewed it in the water,<br />
      and made the children of Israel drink of it. And in the<br />
      twenty-seventh verse we are told what the Lord did:<br /> "Thus saith the
      Lord God of Israel: Put every man<br /> "his sword by his side, and go in
      and out from gate<br /> "to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man<br />
      "his brother, and every man his companion, and<br /> "every man his
      neighbor. And the children of Levi<br /> "did according to the word of
      Moses; and there fell<br /> "of the people that day about three thousand
      men."<br /> <br /> 241<br /> <br /> The reason for this slaughter is thus
      given: "For<br /> "Moses had said: Consecrate yourselves to-day to<br />
      "the Lord, even every man upon his son, and upon<br /> " his brother, that
      he may bestow upon you a blessing<br /> "this day."<br /> <br /> Now, it must
      be remembered that there had not<br /> been as yet a promulgation of the
      commandment<br /> u Thou shalt have no other gods before me." This<br /> was
      a punishment for the infraction of a law before<br /> the law was known&mdash;before
      the commandment had<br /> been given. Was it cruel, or unjust?<br /> <br />
      Does the following sound as though spoken by a<br /> God of mercy: "I will
      make mine arrows drunk<br /> "with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh"?<br />
      And yet this is but a small part of the vengeance and<br /> destruction
      which God threatens to his enemies, as<br /> recorded in the thirty-second
      chapter of the book of<br /> Deuteronomy.<br /> <br /> In the sixty-eighth
      Psalm is found this merciful<br /> passage: "That thy foot may be dipped in
      the blood<br /> "of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the<br />
      "same.<br /> <br /> So we find in the eleventh chapter of Joshua the<br />
      reason why the Canaanites and other nations made<br /> war upon the Jews.
      It is as follows: "For it was of<br /> <br /> 242<br /> <br /> "the Lord to
      harden their hearts that they should<br /> "come against Israel in battle,
      that he might destroy<br /> "them utterly, and that they might have no
      favor, but<br /> "that he might destroy them."<br /> <br /> Read the
      thirtieth chapter of Exodus and you will<br /> find that God gave to Moses
      a recipe for making<br /> the oil of holy anointment, and in the
      thirty-second<br /> verse we find that no one was to make any oil like it<br />
      and in the next verse it is declared that whoever<br /> compounded any like
      it, or whoever put any of it on<br /> a stranger, should be cut off from
      the Lord's people.<br /> <br /> In the same chapter, a recipe is given for
      per-<br /> fumery, and it is declared that whoever shall make<br /> any like
      it, or that smells like it, shall suffer death.<br /> <br /> In the next
      chapter, it is decreed that if any one fails<br /> to keep the Sabbath "he
      shall be surely put to death."<br /> <br /> There are in the Pentateuch
      hundreds and hun-<br /> dreds of passages showing the cruelty of Jehovah.<br />
      What could have been more cruel than the flood?<br /> What more heartless
      than to overwhelm a world?<br /> What more merciless than to cover a
      shoreless sea<br /> with the corpses of men, women and children?<br /> <br />
      The Pentateuch is filled with anathemas, with<br /> curses, with words of
      vengeance, of jealousy, of<br /> hatred, and brutality. By reason of these
      passages,<br /> <br /> 243<br /> <br /> millions of people have plucked from
      their hearts the<br /> flowers of pity and justified the murder of women<br />
      and the assassination of babes.<br /> <br /> In the second chapter of Second
      Kings we find<br /> that the prophet Elisha was on his way to a place<br />
      called Bethel, and as he was going, there came forth<br /> little children
      out of the city and mocked him and<br /> said: "Go up thou bald head; Go up
      thou bald<br /> "head! And he turned back and looked on them<br /> "and
      cursed them in the name of the Lord. And<br /> "there came forth two she
      bears out of the wood and<br /> "tare forty and two children of them."<br />
      <br /> Of course he obtained his miraculous power from<br /> Jehovah; and
      there must have been some communi-<br /> cation between Jehovah and the
      bears. Why did the<br /> bears come? How did they happen to be there?<br />
      Here is a prophet of God cursing children in the<br /> name of the Lord,
      and thereupon these children<br /> are torn in fragments by wild beasts.<br />
      <br /> This is the mercy of Jehovah; and yet I am told<br /> that the Bible
      has nothing cruel in it; that it preaches<br /> only mercy, justice,
      charity, peace; that all hearts<br /> are softened by reading it; that the
      savage nature of<br /> man is melted into tenderness and pity by it, and
      that<br /> only the totally depraved can find evil in it.<br /> <br /> 244<br />
      <br /> And so I might go on, page after page, book after<br /> book, in the
      Old Testament, and describe the cruelties<br /> committed in accordance
      with the commands of<br /> Jehovah.<br /> <br /> But all the cruelties in the
      Old Testament are ab-<br /> solute mercies compared with the hell of the
      New<br /> Testament. In the Old Testament God stops with<br /> the grave. He
      seems to have been satisfied when he<br /> saw his enemies dead, when he
      saw their flesh rotting<br /> in the open air, or in the beaks of birds, or
      in the teeth<br /> of wild beasts. But in the New Testament, ven-<br />
      geance does not stop with the grave. It begins there,<br /> and stops
      never. The enemies of Jehovah are to be<br /> pursued through all the ages
      of eternity. There is to<br /> be no forgiveness&mdash;no cessation, no
      mercy, nothing<br /> but everlasting pain.<br /> <br /> And yet we are told
      that the author of hell is a<br /> being of infinite mercy.<br /> <br /> <i>Second</i>;
      All intelligent Christians will admit that<br /> there are many passages in
      the Bible that, if found in<br /> the Koran, they would regard as impure
      and immoral.<br /> <br /> It is not necessary for me to specify the
      passages,<br /> nor to call the attention of the public to such things.<br />
      I am willing to trust the judgment of every honest<br /> reader, and the
      memory of every biblical student.<br /> <br /> 245<br /> <br /> The Old
      Testament upholds polygamy. That is<br /> infinitely impure. It sanctions
      concubinage. That<br /> is impure; nothing could or can be worse. Hun-<br />
      dreds of things are publicly told that should have re-<br /> mained unsaid.
      No one is made better by reading<br /> the history of Tamar, or the
      biography of Lot, or<br /> the memoirs of Noah, of Dinah, of Sarah and<br />
      Abraham, or of Jacob and Leah and Rachel and others<br /> that I do not
      care to mention. No one is improved<br /> in his morals by reading these
      things.<br /> <br /> All I mean to say is, that the Bible is like other<br />
      books produced by other nations in the same stage<br /> of civilization.
      What one age considers pure, the<br /> next considers impure. What one age
      may consider<br /> just, the next may look upon as infamous. Civiliza-<br />
      tion is a growth. It is continually dying, and continu-<br /> ally being
      born. Old branches rot and fall, new buds<br /> appear. It is a perpetual
      twilight, and a perpetual<br /> dawn&mdash;the death of the old, and the
      birth of the new.<br /> <br /> I do not say, throw away the Bible because
      there<br /> are some foolish passages in it, but I say, throw away<br /> the
      foolish passages. Don't throw away wisdom<br /> because it is found in
      company with folly; but do not<br /> say that folly is wisdom, because it
      is found in its<br /> company. All that is true in the Bible is true
      whether<br /> <br /> 246<br /> <br /> it is inspired or not. All that is true
      did not need to<br /> be inspired. Only that which is not true needs the<br />
      assistance of miracles and wonders. I read the Bible<br /> as I read other
      books. What I believe to be good,<br /> I admit is good; what I think is
      bad, I say is bad;<br /> what I believe to be true, I say is true, and what
      I<br /> believe to be false, I denounce as false.<br /> <br /> <i>Third</i>.
      Let us see whether there are any contra-<br /> dictions in the Bible.<br />
      <br /> A little book has been published, called "Self<br /> "Contradictions
      of the Bible," by J. P. Mendum, of<br /> The Boston Investigator. I find
      many of the apparent<br /> contradictions of the Bible noted in this book.<br />
      <br /> We all know that the Pentateuch is filled with the<br /> commandments
      of God upon the subject of sacrificing<br /> animals. We know that God
      declared, again and<br /> again, that the smell of burning flesh was a
      sweet<br /> savor to him. Chapter after chapter is filled with direc-<br />
      tions how to kill the beasts that were set apart for<br /> sacrifices; what
      to do with their blood, their flesh and<br /> their fat. And yet, in the
      seventh chapter of Jeremiah,<br /> all this is expressly denied, in the
      following language:<br /> "For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded<br />
      "them in the day that I brought them out of the land<br /> "of Egypt,
      concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices."<br /> <br /> 247<br /> <br /> And
      in the sixth chapter of Jeremiah, the same<br /> Jehovah says; "Your burnt
      offerings are not ac-<br /> "ceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me."<br />
      <br /> In the Psalms, Jehovah derides the idea of<br /> sacrifices, and
      says: "Will I eat of the flesh of<br /> "bulls, or drink the blood of
      goats? Offer unto God<br /> "thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the Most<br />
      "High."<br /> <br /> So I find in Isaiah the following: "Bring no more<br />
      "vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me;<br /> "the new moons
      and sabbaths, the calling of as-<br /> "semblies, I cannot away with; it is
      iniquity, even<br /> "the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your<br />
      "appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble<br /> "to me; I am
      weary to bear them." "To what<br /> "purpose is the multitude of your
      sacrifices unto me?<br /> "saith the Lord. I am full of the burnt offerings
      of<br /> "rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not<br /> "in the
      blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.<br /> "When ye come to
      appear before me, who hath re-<br /> "quired this at your hand?"<br /> <br />
      So I find in James: "Let no man say when he is<br /> "tempted: I am tempted
      of God; for God cannot be<br /> "tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any
      man;"<br /> and yet in the twenty-second chapter of Genesis I<br /> <br />
      248<br /> <br /> find this: "And it came to pass after these things,<br />
      "that God did tempt Abraham."<br /> <br /> In Second Samuel we see that he
      tempted David.<br /> He also tempted Job, and Jeremiah says: "O Lord,<br />
      "thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived." To<br /> such an extent was
      Jeremiah deceived, that in the<br /> fourteenth chapter and eighteenth
      verse we find him<br /> crying out to the Lord: "Wilt thou be altogether<br />
      "unto me as a liar?"<br /> <br /> So in Second Thessalonians: "For these
      things<br /> "God shall send them strong delusions, that they<br /> "should
      believe a lie."<br /> <br /> So in First Kings, twenty-second chapter:
      "Behold,<br /> "the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all<br />
      "these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil<br /> "concerning thee."<br />
      <br /> So in Ezekiel: "And if the prophet be deceived<br /> "when he hath
      spoken a thing, I, the Lord, have de-<br /> "ceived that prophet."<br />
      <br /> So I find: "Thou shalt not bear false witness;"<br /> and in the book
      of Revelation: "All liars shall have<br /> "their part in the lake which
      burneth with fire and<br /> "brimstone;" yet in First Kings, twenty-second<br />
      chapter, I find the following: "And the Lord said:<br /> "Who shall
      persuade Ahab, that he may go up and<br /> <br /> 249<br /> <br /> "fall at
      Ramoth-Gilead? And one said on this<br /> "manner, and another said on that
      manner. And<br /> "there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord,<br />
      "and said: I will persuade him. And the Lord said<br /> "unto him:
      Wherewith? And he said: I will go<br /> "forth, and I will be a lying
      spirit in the mouth of all<br /> "his prophets. And he said: Thou shalt
      persuade<br /> "him, and prevail also. Go forth, and do so."<br /> <br /> In
      the Old Testament we find contradictory laws<br /> about the same thing,
      and contradictory accounts of<br /> the same occurrences.<br /> <br /> In the
      twentieth chapter of Exodus we find the first<br /> account of the giving
      of the Ten Commandments. In<br /> the thirty-fourth chapter another account
      of the same<br /> transaction is given. These two accounts could not<br />
      have been written by the same person. Read them,<br /> and you will be
      forced to admit that both of them<br /> cannot by any possibility be true.
      They differ in so<br /> many particulars, and the commandments themselves<br />
      are so different, that it is impossible that both can be<br /> true.<br />
      <br /> So there are two histories of the creation. If you<br /> will read
      the first and second chapters of Genesis,<br /> you will find two accounts
      inconsistent with each<br /> other, both of which cannot be true. The first
      account<br /> <br /> 250<br /> <br /> ends with the third verse of the second
      chapter of<br /> Genesis. By the first account, man and woman were<br />
      made at the same time, and made last of all. In the<br /> second account,
      not to be too critical, all the beasts<br /> of the field were made before
      Eve was, and Adam<br /> was made before the beasts of the field; whereas in<br />
      the first account, God made all the animals before he<br /> made Adam. In
      the first account there is nothing<br /> about the rib or the bone or the
      side,&mdash;that is only<br /> found in the second account. In the first
      account,<br /> there is nothing about the Garden of Eden, nothing<br />
      about the four rivers, nothing about the mist that<br /> went up from the
      earth and watered the whole face<br /> of the ground; nothing said about
      making man from<br /> dust; nothing about God breathing into his nostrils<br />
      the breath of life; yet according to the second ac-<br /> count, the Garden
      of Eden was planted, and all the<br /> animals were made before Eve was
      formed. It is<br /> impossible to harmonize the two accounts.<br /> <br />
      So, in the first account, only the word God is<br /> used&mdash;"God said
      so and so,&mdash;God did so and so."<br /> In the second account he is
      called Lord God,&mdash;"the<br /> "Lord God formed man,"&mdash;"the Lord
      God caused<br /> "it to rain,"&mdash;"the Lord God planted a garden." It<br />
      is now admitted that the book of Genesis is made up<br /> <br /> 251<br />
      <br /> of two stories, and it is very easy to take them apart<br /> and show
      exactly how they were put together.<br /> <br /> So there are two stories of
      the flood, differing<br /> almost entirely from each other&mdash;that is to
      say, so<br /> contradictory that both cannot be true.<br /> <br /> There are
      two accounts of the manner in which<br /> Saul was made king, and the
      accounts are inconsistent<br /> with each other.<br /> <br /> Scholars now
      everywhere admit that the copyists<br /> made many changes, pieced out
      fragments, and made<br /> additions, interpolations, and meaningless
      repetitions.<br /> It is now generally conceded that the speeches of<br />
      Elihu, in Job, were interpolated, and most of the<br /> prophecies were
      made by persons whose names even<br /> are not known.<br /> <br /> The
      manuscripts of the Old Testament were not<br /> alike. The Greek version
      differed from the Hebrew,<br /> and there was no generally received text of
      the Old<br /> Testament until after the beginning of the Christian<br />
      era. Marks and points to denote vowels were in-<br /> vented probably in
      the seventh century after Christ;<br /> and whether these marks and points
      were put in the<br /> proper places, is still an open question. The Alex-<br />
      andrian version, or what is known as the Septuagint,<br /> translated by
      seventy-two learned Jews assisted by<br /> <br /> 252<br /> <br /> miraculous
      power, about two hundred years before<br /> Christ, could not, it is now
      said, have been translated<br /> from the Hebrew text that we now have.
      This can<br /> only be accounted for by supposing that we have a<br />
      different Hebrew text. The early Christians adopted<br /> the Septuagint
      and were satisfied for a time; but so<br /> many errors were found, and so
      many were scanning<br /> every word in search of something to assist their<br />
      peculiar views, that new versions were produced,<br /> and the new versions
      all differed somewhat from the<br /> Septuagint as well as from each other.
      These ver-<br /> sions were mostly in Greek. The first Latin Bible<br /> was
      produced in Africa, and no one has ever found<br /> out which Latin
      manuscript was original. Many were<br /> produced, and all differed from
      each other. These<br /> Latin versions were compared with each other and<br />
      with the Hebrew, and a new Latin version was made<br /> in the fifth
      century, and the old ones held their own<br /> for about four hundred
      years, and no one knows<br /> which version was right. Besides, there were
      Ethi-<br /> opie, Egyptian, Armenian and several other ver-<br /> sions, all
      differing from each other as well as from all<br /> others. It was not
      until the fourteenth century that<br /> the Bible was translated into
      German, and not until<br /> the fifteenth that Bibles were printed in the
      principal<br /> <br /> 253<br /> <br /> languages of Europe; and most of these
      Bibles<br /> differed from each other, and gave rise to endless<br />
      disputes and to almost numberless crimes.<br /> <br /> No man in the world
      is learned enough, nor has<br /> he time enough, even if he could live a
      thousand<br /> years, to find what books belonged to and consti-<br /> tuted
      the Old Testament. He could not ascertain<br /> the authors of the books,
      nor when they were written,<br /> nor what they mean. Until a man has
      sufficient<br /> time to do all this, no one can tell whether he be-<br />
      lieves the Bible or not. It is sufficient, however, to<br /> say that the
      Old Testament is filled with contradic-<br /> tions as to the number of men
      slain in battle, as to<br /> the number of years certain kings reigned, as
      to the<br /> number of a woman's children, as to dates of events,<br /> and
      as to locations of towns and cities.<br /> <br /> Besides all this, many of
      its laws are contradictory,<br /> often commanding and prohibiting the same
      thing.<br /> <br /> The New Testament also is filled with contradic-<br />
      tions. The gospels do not even agree upon the<br /> terms of salvation.
      They do not even agree as to<br /> the gospel of Christ, as to the mission
      of Christ.<br /> They do not tell the same story regarding the be-<br />
      trayal, the crucifixion, the resurrection or the ascen-<br /> sion of
      Christ. John is the only one that ever heard<br /> <br /> 254<br /> <br /> of
      being "born again." The evangelists do not give<br /> the same account of
      the same miracles, and the<br /> miracles are not given in the same order.
      They do<br /> not agree even in the genealogy of Christ.<br /> <br /> <i>Fourth</i>.
      Is the Bible scientific? In my judgment<br /> it is not<br /> <br /> It is
      unscientific to say that this world was "cre-<br /> "ated that the universe
      was produced by an infinite<br /> being, who had existed an eternity prior
      to such<br /> "creation." My mind is such that I cannot possibly<br />
      conceive of a "creation." Neither can I conceive of<br /> an infinite being
      who dwelt in infinite space an infi-<br /> nite length of time.<br /> <br />
      I do not think it is scientific to say that the uni-<br /> verse was made
      in six days, or that this world is only<br /> about six thousand years old,
      or that man has only<br /> been upon the earth for about six thousand
      years.<br /> <br /> If the Bible is true, Adam was the first man. The<br />
      age of Adam is given, the age of his children, and<br /> the time,
      according to the Bible, was kept and known<br /> from Adam, so that if the
      Bible is true, man has only<br /> been in this world about six thousand
      years. In my<br /> judgment, and in the judgment of every scientific<br />
      man whose judgment is worth having or quoting,<br /> man inhabited this
      earth for thousands of ages prior<br /> <br /> 255<br /> <br /> to the
      creation of Adam. On one point the Bible is<br /> at least certain, and
      that is, as to the life of Adam.<br /> The genealogy is given, the pedigree
      is there, and it<br /> is impossible to escape the conclusion that,
      according<br /> to the Bible, man has only been upon this earth<br /> about
      six thousand years. There is no chance there<br /> to say "long periods of
      time," or "geological ages."<br /> There we have the years. And as to the
      time of the<br /> creation of man, the Bible does not tell the truth.<br />
      <br /> What is generally called "The Fall of Man" is<br /> unscientific. God
      could not have made a moral<br /> character for Adam. Even admitting the
      rest of the<br /> story to be true, Adam certainly had to make char-<br />
      acter for himself.<br /> <br /> The idea that there never would have been
      any<br /> disease or death in this world had it not been for the<br />
      eating of the forbidden fruit is preposterously unsci-<br /> entific.
      Admitting that Adam was made only six<br /> thousand years ago, death was
      in the world millions of<br /> years before that time. The old rocks are
      filled with re-<br /> mains of what were once living and breathing animals.<br />
      Continents were built up with the petrified corpses of<br /> animals. We
      know, therefore, that death did not enter<br /> the world because of Adam's
      sin. We know that life<br /> and death are but successive links in an
      eternal chain.<br /> <br /> 256<br /> <br /> So it is unscientific to say that
      thorns and brambles<br /> were produced by Adam's sin.<br /> <br /> It is
      also unscientific to say that labor was pro-<br /> nounced as a curse upon
      man. Labor is not a curse.<br /> Labor is a blessing. Idleness is a curse.<br />
      <br /> It is unscientific to say that the sons of God,<br /> living, we
      suppose, in heaven, fell in love with the<br /> daughters of men, and that
      on account of this a<br /> flood was sent upon the earth that covered the<br />
      highest mountains.<br /> <br /> The whole story of the flood is
      unscientific, and no<br /> scientific man worthy of the name, believes it.<br />
      <br /> Neither is the story of the tower of Babel a scien-<br /> tific
      thing. Does any scientific man believe that<br /> God confounded the
      language of men for fear they<br /> would succeed in building a tower high
      enough to<br /> reach to heaven?<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to say
      that angels were in the<br /> habit of walking about the earth, eating veal
      dressed<br /> with butter and milk, and making bargains about the<br />
      destruction of cities.<br /> <br /> The story of Lot's wife having been
      turned into a<br /> pillar of salt is extremely unscientific.<br /> <br /> It
      is unscientific to say that people at one time lived<br /> to be nearly a
      thousand years of age. The history<br /> <br /> 257<br /> <br /> of the world
      shows that human life is lengthening<br /> instead of shortening.<br />
      <br /> It is unscientific to say that the infinite God<br /> wrestled with
      Jacob and got the better of him, put-<br /> ting his thigh out of joint.<br />
      <br /> It is unscientific to say that God, in the likeness of<br /> a flame
      of fire, inhabited a bush.<br /> <br /> It is unscientific to say that a
      stick could be<br /> changed into a living snake. Living snakes can not<br />
      be made out of sticks. There are not the necessary<br /> elements in a
      stick to make a snake.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to say that God
      changed water<br /> into blood. All the elements of blood are not in<br />
      water.<br /> <br /> It is unscientific to declare that dust was changed<br />
      into lice.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to say that God caused a thick<br />
      darkness over the land of Egypt, and yet allowed it<br /> to be light in
      the houses of the Jews.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to say that about
      seventy people<br /> could, in two hundred and fifteen years increase to<br />
      three millions.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to say that an infinitely
      good<br /> God would destroy innocent people to get revenge<br /> upon a
      king.<br /> <br /> 258<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to say that slavery
      was once<br /> right, that polygamy was once a virtue, and that ex-<br />
      termination was mercy.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to assert that a
      being of infinite<br /> power and goodness went into partnership with in-<br />
      sects,&mdash;granted letters of marque and reprisal to<br /> hornets.<br />
      <br /> It is unscientific to insist that bread was really<br /> rained from
      heaven.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to suppose that an infinite being<br />
      spent forty days and nights furnishing Moses with plans<br /> and
      specifications for a tabernacle, an ark, a mercy seat,<br /> cherubs of
      gold, a table, four rings, some dishes, some<br /> spoons, one candlestick,
      several bowls, a few knobs,<br /> seven lamps, some snuffers, a pair of
      tongs, some cur-<br /> tains, a roof for a tent of rams' skins dyed red, a
      few<br /> boards, an altar with horns, ash pans, basins and flesh<br />
      hooks, shovels and pots and sockets of silver and<br /> ouches of gold and
      pins of brass&mdash;for all of which this<br /> God brought with him
      patterns from heaven.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to say that when a
      man commits<br /> a sin, he can settle with God by killing a sheep.<br />
      <br /> It is not scientific to say that a priest, by laying<br /> his hands
      on the head of a goat, can transfer the sins<br /> of a people to the
      animal.<br /> <br /> 259<br /> <br /> Was it scientific to endeavor to
      ascertain whether<br /> a woman was virtuous or not, by compelling her to<br />
      drink water mixed with dirt from the floor of the<br /> sanctuary?<br />
      <br /> Is it scientific to say that a dry stick budded,<br /> blossomed, and
      bore almonds; or that the ashes of a<br /> red heifer mixed with water can
      cleanse us of sin;<br /> or that a good being gave cities into the hands of
      the<br /> Jews in consideration of their murdering all the in-<br />
      habitants?<br /> <br /> Is it scientific to say that an animal saw an angel,<br />
      and conversed with a man?<br /> <br /> Is it scientific to imagine that
      thrusting a spear<br /> through the body of a woman ever stayed a plague?<br />
      <br /> Is it scientific to say that a river cut itself in two<br /> and
      allowed the lower end to run off?<br /> <br /> Is it scientific to assert
      that seven priests blew<br /> seven rams' horns loud enough to blow down
      the<br /> walls of a city?<br /> <br /> Is it scientific to say that the sun
      stood still in the<br /> midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down for<br />
      about a whole day, and that the moon also stayed?<br /> <br /> Is it
      scientifically probable that an angel of the<br /> Lord devoured unleavened
      cakes and broth with<br /> fire that came out of the end of a stick, as he
      sat<br /> <br /> 260<br /> <br /> under an oak tree; or that God made known
      his<br /> will by letting dew fall on wool without wetting the<br /> ground
      around it; or that an angel of God appeared<br /> to Manoah in the absence
      of her husband, and that<br /> this angel afterwards went up in a flame of
      fire, and<br /> as the result of this visit a child was born whose<br />
      strength was in his hair?<br /> <br /> Is it scientific to say that the
      muscle of a man de-<br /> pended upon the length of his locks?<br /> <br />
      Is it unscientific to deny that water gushed from a<br /> hollow place in a
      dry bone?<br /> <br /> Is it evidence of a thoroughly scientific mind to<br />
      believe that one man turned over a house so large<br /> that three thousand
      people were on its roof?<br /> <br /> Is it purely scientific to say that a
      man was once<br /> fed by the birds of the air, who brought him bread<br />
      and meat every morning and evening, and that after-<br /> ward an angel
      turned cook and prepared two sup-<br /> pers in one night, for the same
      prophet, who ate<br /> enough to last him forty days and forty nights?<br />
      <br /> Is it scientific to say that a river divided because<br /> the water
      had been struck with a cloak; or that a<br /> man actually went to heaven
      in a chariot of fire<br /> drawn by horses of fire; or that a being of
      infinite<br /> mercy would destroy children for laughing at a bald-<br />
      <br /> 261<br /> <br /> headed prophet; or curse children and childrens<br />
      children with leprosy for a father's fault; or that he<br /> made iron
      float in water; or that when one corpse<br /> touched another it came to
      life; or that the sun went<br /> backward in heaven so that the shadow on a
      sun-<br /> dial went back ten degrees, as a sign that a miserable<br />
      barbarian king would get well?<br /> <br /> Is it scientific to say that the
      earth not only<br /> stopped in its rotary motion, but absolutely turned<br />
      the other way,&mdash;that its motion was reversed simply<br /> as a sign to
      a petty king?<br /> <br /> Is it scientific to say that Solomon made gold
      and<br /> silver at Jerusalem as plentiful as stones, when we<br /> know
      that there were kings in his day who could<br /> have thrown away the value
      of the whole of Palestine<br /> without missing the amount?<br /> <br /> Is
      it scientific to say that Solomon exceeded all<br /> the kings of the earth
      in glory, when his country<br /> was barren, without roads, when his people
      were<br /> few, without commerce, without the arts, without the<br />
      sciences, without education, without luxuries?<br /> <br /> According to the
      Bible, as long as Jehovah attended<br /> to the affairs of the Jews, they
      had nothing but war,<br /> pestilence and famine; after Jehovah abandoned
      them,<br /> and the Christians ceased, in a measure, to persecute<br />
      <br /> 262<br /> <br /> them, the Jews became the most prosperous of people.<br />
      Since Jehovah in his anger cast them away, they have<br /> produced
      painters, sculptors, scientists, statesmen,<br /> composers, soldiers and
      philosophers.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to believe that God ever
      pre-<br /> vented rain, that he ever caused famine, that he ever<br /> sent
      locusts to devour the wheat and corn, that he<br /> ever relied on
      pestilence for the government of man-<br /> kind; or that he ever killed
      children to get even with<br /> their parents.<br /> <br /> It is not
      scientific to believe that the king of Egypt<br /> invaded Palestine with
      seventy thousand horsemen<br /> and twelve hundred chariots of war. There
      was not,<br /> at that time, a road in Palestine over which a chariot<br />
      could be driven.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to believe that in a
      battle between<br /> Jeroboam and Abijah, the army of Abijah slew in<br />
      one day five hundred thousand chosen men.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific
      to believe that Zerah, the Ethio-<br /> pian, invaded Palestine with a
      million of men who<br /> were overthrown and destroyed; or that Jehoshaphat<br />
      had a standing army of nine hundred and sixty<br /> thousand men.<br />
      <br /> It is unscientific to believe that Jehovah advertised<br /> for a
      liar, as is related in Second Chronicles.<br /> <br /> 263<br /> <br /> It is
      not scientific to believe that fire refused to<br /> burn, or that water
      refused to wet.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to believe in dreams, in
      visions,<br /> and in miracles.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to believe
      that children have<br /> been born without fathers, that the dead have ever<br />
      been raised to life, or that people have bodily as-<br /> cended to heaven
      taking their clothes with them.<br /> <br /> It is not scientific to believe
      in the supernatural.<br /> Science dwells in the realm of fact, in the
      realm of<br /> demonstration. Science depends upon human ex-<br /> perience,
      upon observation, upon reason.<br /> <br /> It is unscientific to say that
      an innocent man can<br /> be punished in place of a criminal, and for a
      criminal,<br /> and that the criminal, on account of such punishment,<br />
      can be justified.<br /> <br /> It is unscientific to say that a finite sin
      deserves<br /> infinite punishment.<br /> <br /> It is unscientific to
      believe that devils can inhabit<br /> human beings, or that they can take
      possession of<br /> swine, or that the devil could bodily take a man, or<br />
      the Son of God, and carry him to the pinnacle of a<br /> temple.<br /> <br />
      In short, the foolish, the unreasonable, the false,<br /> the miraculous
      and the supernatural are unscientific.<br /> <br /> 264<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Mr. Talmage gives his reason for<br /> accepting the New Testament, and
      says: "You<br /> "can trace it right out. Jerome and Eusebius in the<br />
      "first century, and Origen in the second century,<br /> "gave lists of the
      writers of the New Testament.<br /> "These lists correspond with our list
      of the writers<br /> "of the New Testament, showing that precisely as<br />
      "we have it, they had it in the third and fourth cen-<br /> "turies. Where
      did they get it? From Iren&aelig;us.<br /> "Where did he get it? From
      Polycarp. Where did<br /> "Polycarp get it? From Saint John, who was a per-<br />
      "sonal associate of Jesus. The line is just as clear<br /> "as anything
      ever was clear." How do you under-<br /> stand this matter, and has Mr.
      Talmage stated the<br /> facts?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Let us examine
      first the witnesses pro-<br /> duced by Mr. Talmage. We will also call
      attention<br /> to the great principle laid down by Mr. Talmage for<br />
      the examination of evidence,&mdash;that where a witness<br /> is found
      false in one particular, his entire testimony<br /> must be thrown away.<br />
      <br /> Eusebius was born somewhere about two hundred<br /> and seventy years
      after Christ. After many vicissi-<br /> tudes he became, it is said, the
      friend of Constantine.<br /> He made an oration in which he extolled the
      virtues<br /> <br /> 265<br /> <br /> of this murderer, and had the honor of
      sitting at the<br /> right hand of the man who had shed the blood of his<br />
      wife and son. In the great controversy with regard<br /> to the position
      that Christ should occupy in the Trinity,<br /> he sided with Arius, "and
      lent himself to the perse-<br /> "cution of the orthodox with Athanasius."
      He in-<br /> sisted that Jesus Christ was not the same as God,<br /> and
      that he was not of equal power and glory. Will<br /> Mr. Talmage admit that
      his witness told the truth in<br /> this? "He would not even call the Son
      co-eternal<br /> "with God."<br /> <br /> Eusebius must have been an
      exceedingly truthful<br /> man. He declared that the tracks of Pharaoh's
      chariots<br /> were in his day visible upon the shores of the Red<br /> Sea;
      that these tracks had been through all the years<br /> miraculously
      preserved from the action of wind and<br /> wave, as a supernatural
      testimony to the fact that<br /> God miraculously overwhelmed Pharaoh and
      his<br /> hosts.<br /> <br /> Eusebius also relates that when Joseph and Mary<br />
      arrived in Eygpt they took up their abode in Hermopolis,<br /> <br /> a city
      of Theb&aelig;us, in which was the superb<br /> temple of Serapis. When
      Joseph and Mary entered<br /> the temple, not only the great idol, but all
      the lesser<br /> idols fell down before him.<br /> <br /> 266<br /> <br /> "It
      is believed by the learned Dr. Lardner, that<br /> "Eusebius was the one
      guilty of the forgery in the<br /> "passage found in Josephus concerning
      Christ. Un-<br /> "blushing falsehoods and literary forgeries of the<br />
      "vilest character darkened the pages of his historical<br /> "writings."
      (Waites History.)<br /> <br /> From the same authority I learn that Eusebius<br />
      invented an eclipse, and some earthquakes, to agree<br /> with the account
      of the crucifixion. It is also be-<br /> lieved that Eusebius quoted from
      works that never<br /> existed, and that he pretended a work had been<br />
      written by Porphyry, entitled: "The Philosophy of<br /> "Oracles," and then
      quoted from it for the purpose<br /> of proving the truth of the Christian
      religion.<br /> <br /> The fact is, Eusebius was utterly destitute of truth.<br />
      He believed, as many still believe, that he could<br /> please God by the
      fabrication of lies.<br /> <br /> Iren&aelig;us lived somewhere about the
      end of the<br /> second century. "Very little is known of his early<br />
      "history, and the accounts given in various biogra-<br /> "phies are for
      the most part conjectural." The<br /> writings of Iren&aelig;us are known
      to us principally<br /> through Eusebius, and we know the value of his<br />
      testimony.<br /> <br /> Now, if we are to take the testimony of Iren&aelig;us,<br />
      <br /> 267<br /> <br /> why not take it? He says that the ministry of Christ<br />
      lasted for twenty years, and that Christ was fifty years<br /> old at the
      time of his crucifixion. He also insisted<br /> that the "Gospel of Paul"
      was written by Luke, "a<br /> "statement made to give sanction to the
      gospel of<br /> "Luke."<br /> <br /> Iren&aelig;us insisted that there were
      four gospels, that<br /> there must be, and "he speaks frequently of these<br />
      "gospels, and argues that they should be four in<br /> "number, neither
      more nor less, because there are<br /> "four universal winds, and four
      quarters of the<br /> "world;" and he might have added: because<br />
      donkeys have four legs.<br /> <br /> These facts can be found in "The
      History of the<br /> "Christian Religion to A. D. 200," by Charles B.<br />
      Waite,&mdash;a book that Mr. Talmage ought to read.<br /> <br /> According
      to Mr. Waite, Iren&aelig;us, in the thirty-<br /> third chapter of his
      fifth book, <i>Adversus H&aelig;reses</i>,<br /> cites from Papias the
      following sayings of Christ:<br /> "The days will come in which vines shall
      grow<br /> "which shall have ten thousand branches, and on<br /> "each
      branch ten thousand twigs, and in each twig<br /> "ten thousand shoots, and
      in each shoot ten thousand<br /> "clusters, and in every one of the
      clusters ten<br /> "thousand grapes, and every grape when pressed<br />
      <br /> 268<br /> <br /> "will give five and twenty metrets of wine." Also<br />
      that "one thousand million pounds of clear, pure, fine<br /> "flour will be
      produced from one grain of wheat."<br /> Iren&aelig;us adds that "these
      things were borne witness<br /> "to by Papias the hearer of John and the
      companion<br /> "of Polycarp."<br /> <br /> Is it possible that the eternal
      welfare of a human<br /> being depends upon believing the testimony of
      Poly-<br /> carp and Iren&aelig;us? Are people to be saved or lost<br /> on
      the reputation of Eusebius? Suppose a man is<br /> firmly convinced that
      Polycarp knew nothing about<br /> Saint John, and that Saint John knew
      nothing about<br /> Christ,&mdash;what then? Suppose he is convinced that<br />
      Eusebius is utterly unworthy of credit,&mdash;what then?<br /> Must a man
      believe statements that he has every<br /> reason to think are false?<br />
      <br /> The question arises as to the witnesses named by<br /> Mr. Talmage,
      whether they were competent to decide<br /> as to the truth or falsehood of
      the gospels. We have<br /> the right to inquire into their mental traits
      for the<br /> purpose of giving only due weight to what they have<br />
      said.<br /> <br /> Mr. Bronson C. Keeler is the author of a book<br />
      called: "A Short History of the Bible." I avail<br /> myself of a few of
      the facts he has there collected. I<br /> <br /> 269<br /> <br /> find in this
      book, that Iren&aelig;us, Clement and Origen<br /> believed in the fable of
      the Phoenix, and insisted that<br /> God produced the bird on purpose to
      prove the<br /> probability of the resurrection of the body. Some<br /> of
      the early fathers believed that the hyena changed<br /> its sex every year.
      Others of them gave as a reason<br /> why good people should eat only
      animals with a<br /> cloven foot, the fact that righteous people lived not<br />
      only in this world, but had expectations in the next.<br /> They also
      believed that insane people were pos-<br /> sessed by devils; that angels
      ate manna; that some<br /> angels loved the daughters of men and fell; that
      the<br /> pains of women in childbirth, and the fact that ser-<br /> pents
      crawl on their bellies, were proofs that the<br /> account of the fall, as
      given in Genesis, is true; that<br /> the stag renewed its youth by eating
      poisonous<br /> snakes; that eclipses and comets were signs of God's<br />
      anger; that volcanoes were openings into hell; that<br /> demons blighted
      apples; that a corpse in a cemetery<br /> moved to make room for another
      corpse to be placed<br /> beside it. Clement of Alexandria believed that
      hail<br /> storms, tempests and plagues were caused by demons.<br /> He also
      believed, with Mr. Talmage, that the events<br /> in the life of Abraham
      were typical and prophetical<br /> of arithmetic and astronomy.<br /> <br />
      270<br /> <br /> Origen, another of the witnesses of Mr. Talmage,<br /> said
      that the sun, moon and stars were living crea-<br /> tures, endowed with
      reason and free will, and occa-<br /> sionally inclined to sin. That they
      had free will, he<br /> proved by quoting from Job; that they were rational<br />
      creatures, he inferred from the fact that they moved.<br /> The sun, moon
      and stars, according to him, were<br /> "subject to vanity," and he
      believed that they prayed<br /> to God through his only begotten son.<br />
      <br /> These intelligent witnesses believed that the blight-<br /> ing of
      vines and fruit trees, and the disease and de-<br /> struction that came
      upon animals and men, were all<br /> the work of demons; but that when they
      had entered<br /> into men, the sign of the cross would drive them out.<br />
      They derided the idea that the earth is round, and<br /> one of them said:
      "About the antipodes also, one<br /> "can neither hear nor speak without
      laughter. It is<br /> "asserted as something serious that we should be-<br />
      "lieve that there are men who have their feet oppo-<br /> "site to ours.
      The ravings of Anaxagoras are more<br /> "tolerable, who said that snow was
      black."<br /> <br /> Concerning these early fathers, Professor Davidson,<br />
      as quoted by Mr. Keeler, uses the following lan-<br /> guage: "Of the three
      fathers who contributed<br /> "most to the growth of the canon, Iren&aelig;us
      was<br /> <br /> 271<br /> <br /> "credulous and blundering; Tertullian
      passionate<br /> "and one-sided; and Clement of Alexandria, im-<br /> "bued
      with the treasures of Greek wisdom, was<br /> "mainly occupied with
      ecclesiastical ethics. Their<br /> "assertions show both ignorance and
      exaggeration."<br /> These early fathers relied upon by Mr. Talmage,<br />
      quoted from books now regarded as apocryphal&mdash;<br /> books that have
      been thrown away by the church<br /> and are no longer considered as of the
      slightest<br /> authority. Upon this subject I again quote Mr.<br /> Keeler:
      "Clement quoted the 'Gospel according to<br /> "'the Hebrews,' which is now
      thrown away by the<br /> "church; he also quoted from the Sibylline books<br />
      "and the Pentateuch in the same sentence. Origen<br /> "frequently cited
      the Gospel of the Hebrews. Jerome<br /> "did the same, and Clement believed
      in the 'Gospel<br /> "'according to the Egyptians.' The Shepherd of<br />
      "Hermas, a book in high repute in the early church,<br /> "and one which
      distinctly claims to have been<br /> "inspired, was quoted by Iren&aelig;us
      as Scripture.<br /> "Clement of Alexandria said it was a divine revela-<br />
      "tion. Origen said it was divinely inspired, and<br /> "quoted it as Holy
      Scripture at the same time that<br /> "he cited the Psalms and Epistles of
      Paul. Jerome<br /> "quoted the 'Wisdom of Jesus, the Son of Sirach,'<br />
      <br /> 272<br /> <br /> "as divine Scripture. Origen quotes the 'Wisdom<br />
      "of Solomon' as the 'Word of God' and 'the<br /> "'words of Christ
      himself.' Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea<br /> "cites it as a * Divine Oracle,'
      and St. Chrysostom<br /> "used it as Scripture. So Eusebius quotes the<br />
      "thirteenth chapter of Daniel as Scripture, but as a<br /> "matter of fact,
      Daniel has not a thirteenth chapter,&mdash;<br /> "the church has taken it
      away. Clement spoke of<br /> "the writer of the fourth book of Esdras as a
      prophet;<br /> "he thought Baruch as much the word of God as<br /> "any
      other book, and he quotes it as divine Scripture.<br /> "Clement cites
      Barnabas as an apostle. Origen<br /> "quotes from the Epistle of Barnabas,
      calls it 'Holy<br /> " 'Scripture,' and places it on a level with the
      Psalms<br /> "and the Epistles of Paul; and Clement of Alexan-<br /> "dria
      believed in the 'Epistle of Barnabas,' and the<br /> "'Revelation, of
      Peter,' and wrote comments upon<br /> "these holy books."<br /> <br />
      Nothing can exceed the credulity of the early<br /> fathers, unless it may
      be their ignorance. They be-<br /> lieved everything that was miraculous.
      They believed<br /> everything except the truth. Anything that really<br />
      happened was considered of no importance by them.<br /> They looked for
      wonders, miracles, and monstrous<br /> things, and&mdash;generally found
      them. They revelled<br /> <br /> 273<br /> <br /> in the misshapen and the
      repulsive. They did not<br /> think it wrong to swear falsely in a good
      cause.<br /> They interpolated, forged, and changed the records to<br />
      suit themselves, for the sake of Christ. They quoted<br /> from persons who
      never wrote. They misrepresented<br /> those who had written, and their
      evidence is abso-<br /> lutely worthless. They were ignorant, credulous,<br />
      mendacious, fanatical, pious, unreasonable, bigoted,<br /> hypocritical,
      and for the most part, insane. Read the<br /> book of Revelation, and you
      will agree with me that<br /> nothing that ever emanated from a madhouse
      can<br /> more than equal it for incoherence. Most of the<br /> writings of
      the early fathers are of the same kind.<br /> <br /> As to Saint John, the
      real truth is, that we know<br /> nothing certainly of him. We do not know
      that he<br /> ever lived.<br /> <br /> We know nothing certainly of Jesus
      Christ. We<br /> know nothing of his infancy, nothing of his youth,<br />
      and we are not sure that such a person ever existed.<br /> <br /> We know
      nothing of Polycarp. We do not know<br /> where he was born, or where, or
      how he died. We<br /> know nothing for certain about Iren&aelig;us. All the<br />
      names quoted by Mr. Talmage as his witnesses<br /> are surrounded by clouds
      and doubts, by mist and<br /> darkness. We only know that many of their<br />
      <br /> 274<br /> <br /> statements are false, and do not know that any of<br />
      them are true.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What do you think of the
      following state-<br /> ment by Mr. Talmage: "Oh, I have to tell you that no<br />
      "man ever died for a lie cheerfully and triumphantly"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      There was a time when men "cheerfully<br /> "and triumphantly died" in
      defence of the doctrine<br /> of the "real presence" of God in the wafer
      and wine.<br /> Does Mr. Talmage believe in the doctrine of "tran-<br />
      "substantiation"? Yet hundreds have died "cheer-<br /> "fully and
      triumphantly" for it. Men have died for<br /> the idea that baptism by
      immersion is the only<br /> scriptural baptism. Did they die for a lie? If
      not,<br /> is Mr. Talmage a Baptist?<br /> <br /> Giordano Bruno was an
      atheist, yet he perished at<br /> the stake rather than retract his
      opinions. He did<br /> not expect to be welcomed by angels and by God.<br />
      He did not look for a crown of glory. He expected<br /> simply death and
      eternal extinction. Does the fact<br /> that he died for that belief prove
      its truth?<br /> <br /> Thousands upon thousands have died in defence of<br />
      the religion of Mohammed. Was Mohammed an im-<br /> postor? Thousands have
      welcomed death in defence<br /> of the doctrines of Buddha. Is Buddhism
      true?<br /> <br /> 275<br /> <br /> So I might make a tour of the world, and
      of all<br /> ages of human history, and find that millions and<br />
      millions have died "cheerfully and triumphantly" in<br /> defence of their
      opinions. There is not the slightest<br /> truth in Mr. Talmage's
      statement.<br /> <br /> A little while ago, a man shot at the Czar of
      Russia.<br /> On the day of his execution he was asked if he<br /> wished
      religious consolation. He replied that he<br /> believed in no religion.
      What did that prove? It<br /> proved only the man's honesty of opinion. All
      the<br /> martyrs in the world cannot change, never did<br /> change, a
      falsehood into a truth, nor a truth into<br /> a falsehood. Martyrdom
      proves nothing but the<br /> sincerity of the martyr and the cruelty and
      mean-<br /> ness of his murderers. Thousands and thousands of<br /> people
      have imagined that they knew things, that<br /> they were certain, and have
      died rather than retract<br /> their honest beliefs.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage
      now says that he knows all about the<br /> Old Testament, that the
      prophecies were fulfilled,<br /> and yet he does not know when the
      prophecies were<br /> made&mdash;whether they were made before or after the<br />
      fact. He does not know whether the destruction of<br /> Babylon was told
      before it happened, or after. He<br /> knows nothing upon the subject. He
      does not know<br /> <br /> 276<br /> <br /> who made the pretended prophecies.
      He does not<br /> know that Isaiah, or Jeremiah, or Habakkuk, or<br /> Hosea
      ever lived in this world. He does not know<br /> who wrote a single book of
      the Old Testament. He<br /> knows nothing on the subject. He believes in
      the<br /> inspiration of the Old Testament because ancient<br /> cities
      finally fell into decay&mdash;were overrun and de-<br /> stroyed by
      enemies, and he accounts for the fact that<br /> the Jew does not lose his
      nationality by saying that<br /> the Old Testament is true.<br /> <br /> The
      Jews have been persecuted by the Christians,<br /> and they are still
      persecuted by them; and Mr. Tal-<br /> mage seems to think that this
      persecution was a part<br /> of Gods plan, that the Jews might, by
      persecution,<br /> be prevented from mingling with other nationalities,<br />
      and so might stand, through the instrumentality of<br /> perpetual hate and
      cruelty, the suffering witnesses of<br /> the divine truth of the Bible.<br />
      <br /> The Jews do not testify to the truth of the Bible,<br /> but to the
      barbarism and inhumanity of Christians&mdash;<br /> to the meanness and
      hatred of what we are pleased<br /> to call the "civilized world." They
      testify to the fact<br /> that nothing so hardens the human heart as
      religion.<br /> <br /> There is no prophecy in the Old Testament fore-<br />
      telling the coming of Jesus Christ. There is not one<br /> <br /> 277<br />
      <br /> word in the Old Testament referring to him in any<br /> way&mdash;not
      one word. The only way to prove this<br /> is to take your Bible, and
      wherever you find these<br /> words: "That it might be fulfilled," and
      "which<br /> "was spoken," turn to the Old Testament and<br /> find what was
      written, and you will see that it had<br /> not the slightest possible
      reference to the thing re-<br /> counted in the New Testament&mdash;not the
      slightest.<br /> <br /> Let us take some of the prophecies of the Bible,<br />
      and see how plain they are, and how beautiful they<br /> are. Let us see
      whether any human being can tell<br /> whether they have ever been
      fulfilled or not.<br /> <br /> Here is a vision of Ezekiel: "I looked, and
      be-<br /> "hold a whirlwind came out of the north, a great<br /> "cloud, and
      a fire infolding itself, and a brightness<br /> "was about it, and out of
      the midst thereof as the<br /> "color of amber, out of the midst of the
      fire. Also<br /> "out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four<br />
      "living creatures. And this was their appearance;<br /> "they had the
      likeness of a man. And every one<br /> "had four faces, and every one had
      four wings.<br /> "And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of<br />
      "their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they<br /> "sparkled
      like the color of burnished brass. And<br /> "they had the hands of a man
      under their wings on<br /> <br /> 278<br /> <br /> "their four sides; and they
      four had their faces and<br /> "their wings. Their wings were joined one to<br />
      "another; they turned not when-they went; they<br /> "went every one
      straight forward. As for the like-<br /> "ness of their faces, they four
      had the face of a man,<br /> "and the face of a lion, on the right side:
      and they<br /> "four had the face of an ox on the left side; they<br />
      "four also had the face of an eagle.<br /> <br /> "Thus were their faces:
      and their wings were<br /> "stretched upward; two wings of every one were<br />
      "joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.<br /> "And they went
      every one straight forward: whither<br /> "the spirit was to go, they went;
      and they turned not<br /> "when they went.<br /> <br /> "As for the likeness
      of the living creatures, their<br /> "appearance was like burning coals of
      fire, and like<br /> "the appearance of lamps: it went up and down<br />
      "among the living creatures; and the fire was bright,<br /> "and out of the
      fire went forth lightning. And the<br /> "living creatures ran and returned
      as the appearance<br /> "of a flash of lightning.<br /> <br /> "Now as I
      beheld the living creatures, behold one<br /> "wheel upon the earth by the
      living creatures, with<br /> "his four faces. The appearance of the wheels
      and<br /> "their work was like unto the color of a beryl: and<br /> <br />
      279<br /> <br /> "they four had one likeness: and their appearance<br /> "and
      their work was as it were a wheel in the middle<br /> "of a wheel. When
      they went, they went upon<br /> "their four sides: and they turned not when
      they<br /> "went. As for their rings, they were so high that<br /> "they
      were dreadful; and their rings were full of<br /> "eyes round about them
      four. And when the living<br /> "creatures went, the wheels went by them:
      and<br /> "when the living creatures were lifted up from the<br /> "earth,
      the wheels were lifted up. Whithersoever<br /> "the spirit was to go, they
      went, thither was their<br /> "spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up
      over<br /> "against them: for the spirit of the living creature<br /> "was
      in the wheels. When those went, these went;<br /> "and when those stood,
      these stood; and when those<br /> "were lifted up from the earth, the
      wheels were<br /> "lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the<br />
      "living creature was in the wheels. And the like-<br /> "ness of the
      firmament upon the heads of the living<br /> "creature was as the color of
      the terrible crystal,<br /> "stretched forth over their heads above. And
      under<br /> "the firmament were their wings straight, the one<br /> "toward
      the other; every one had two, which<br /> "covered on this side, and every
      one had two,<br /> "which covered on that side, their bodies."<br /> <br />
      280<br /> <br /> Is such a vision a prophecy? Is it calculated<br /> to
      convey the slightest information? If so, what?<br /> <br /> So, the
      following vision of the prophet Daniel is<br /> exceedingly important and
      instructive:<br /> <br /> "Daniel spake and said: I saw in my vision by<br />
      "night, and behold, the four winds of the heaven<br /> "strove upon the
      great sea. And four great beasts<br /> "came up from the sea, diverse one
      from another.<br /> "The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings:<br />
      "I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it<br /> "was lifted up
      from the earth, and made stand upon<br /> "the feet as a man, and a man's
      heart was given to<br /> "it. And behold another beast, a second, like to a<br />
      "bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had<br /> "three ribs in
      the mouth of it between the teeth of<br /> "it: and they said thus unto it,
      Arise, devour much<br /> "flesh.<br /> <br /> "After this I beheld, and lo
      another, like a leopard,<br /> "which had upon the back of it four wings of
      a fowl;<br /> "the beast had also four heads, and dominion was<br /> "given
      to it.<br /> <br /> "After this I saw in the night visions, and behold<br />
      "a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong ex-<br /> "ceedingly;
      and it had great iron teeth; it devoured<br /> "and brake in pieces, and
      stamped the residue with<br /> <br /> 281<br /> <br /> "the feet of it; and it
      was diverse from all the beasts<br /> "that were before it, and it had ten
      horns. I con-<br /> "sidered the horns, and, behold, there came up<br />
      "among them another little horn, before whom<br /> "there were three of the
      first horns plucked up by<br /> "the roots: and behold, in this horn were
      eyes like<br /> "the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great<br /> "things."<br />
      <br /> I have no doubt that this prophecy has been liter-<br /> ally
      fulfilled, but I am not at present in condition to<br /> give the time,
      place, or circumstances.<br /> <br /> A few moments ago, my attention was
      called to<br /> the following extract from <i>The New York Herald</i> of<br />
      the thirteenth of March, instant:<br /> <br /> "At the Fifth Avenue Baptist
      Church, Dr. Armi-<br /> "tage took as his text, 'A wheel in the middle of a<br />
      "'wheel'&mdash;Ezekiel, i., 16. Here, said the preacher,<br /> "are three
      distinct visions in one&mdash;the living crea-<br /> "tures, the moving
      wheels and the fiery throne. We<br /> "have time only to stop the wheels of
      this mystic<br /> "chariot of Jehovah, that we may hold holy converse<br />
      "with Him who rides upon the wings of the wind.<br /> "In this vision of
      the prophet we have a minute and<br /> "amplified account of these
      magnificent symbols or<br /> "hieroglyphics, this wondrous machinery which
      de-<br /> <br /> 282<br /> <br /> "notes immense attributes and agencies and
      voli-<br /> "tions, passing their awful and mysterious course of<br />
      "power and intelligence in revolution after revolu-<br /> "tion of the
      emblematical mechanism, in steady and<br /> "harmonious advancement to the
      object after which<br /> "they are reaching. We are compelled to look<br />
      "upon the whole as symbolical of that tender and<br /> "endearing
      providence of which Jesus spoke when<br /> "He said, 'The very hairs of
      your head are num-<br /> "* bered.'"<br /> <br /> Certainly, an ordinary
      person, not having been<br /> illuminated by the spirit of prophecy, would
      never<br /> have even dreamed that there was the slightest re-<br /> ference
      in Ezekiel's vision to anything like counting<br /> hairs. As a
      commentator, the Rev. Dr. Armitage<br /> has no equal; and, in my judgment,
      no rival. He<br /> has placed himself beyond the reach of ridicule. It<br />
      is impossible to say anything about his sermon as<br /> laughable as his
      sermon.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Have you no confidence in any pro-<br />
      phecies? Do you take the ground that there never<br /> has been a human
      being who could predict the<br /> future?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I admit
      that a man of average intelli-<br /> <br /> 283<br /> <br /> gence knows that
      a certain course, when pursued<br /> long enough, will bring national
      disaster, and it is<br /> perfectly safe to predict the downfall of any and<br />
      every country in the world. In my judgment,<br /> nations, like
      individuals, have an average life.<br /> Every nation is mortal. An
      immortal nation cannot<br /> be constructed of mortal individuals. A nation
      has<br /> a reason for existing, and that reason sustains the<br /> same
      relation to the nation that the acorn does to<br /> the oak. The nation
      will attain its growth&mdash;other<br /> things being equal. It will reach
      its manhood and<br /> its prime, but it will sink into old age, and at last<br />
      must die. Probably, in a few thousand years, men<br /> will be able to
      calculate the average life of nations,<br /> as they now calculate the
      average life of persons.<br /> There has been no period since the morning
      of his-<br /> tory until now, that men did not know of dead and<br /> dying
      nations. There has always been a national<br /> cemetery. Poland is dead,
      Turkey is dying. In<br /> every nation are the seeds of dissolution. Not
      only<br /> nations die, but races of men. A nation is born,<br /> becomes
      powerful, luxurious, at last grows weak, is<br /> overcome, dies, and
      another takes its place, In this<br /> way civilization and barbarism, like
      day and night,<br /> alternate through all of history's years.<br /> <br />
      284<br /> <br /> In every nation there are at least two classes of<br /> men:
      First, the enthusiastic, the patriotic, who be-<br /> lieve that the nation
      will live forever,&mdash;that its flag<br /> will float while the earth has
      air; Second, the owls<br /> and ravens and croakers, who are always
      predicting<br /> disaster, defeat, and death. To the last class belong<br />
      the Jeremiahs, Ezekiels, and Isaiahs of the Jews.<br /> They were always
      predicting the downfall of Jeru-<br /> salem. They revelled in defeat and
      captivity. They<br /> loved to paint the horrors of famine and war. For<br />
      the most part, they were envious, hateful, misan-<br /> thropic and unjust.<br />
      <br /> There seems to have been a war between church<br /> and state. The
      prophets were endeavoring to pre-<br /> serve the ecclesiastical power.
      Every king who would<br /> listen to them, was chosen of God. He instantly<br />
      became the model of virtue, and the prophets assured<br /> him that he was
      in the keeping of Jehovah. But if<br /> the king had a mind of his own, the
      prophets im-<br /> mediately called down upon him all the curses of<br />
      heaven, and predicted the speedy destruction of his<br /> kingdom.<br />
      <br /> If our own country should be divided, if an empire<br /> should rise
      upon the ruins of the Republic, it would<br /> be very easy to find that
      hundreds and thousands of<br /> <br /> 285<br /> <br /> people had foretold
      that very thing. If you will read<br /> the political speeches of the last
      twenty-two years,<br /> you will find prophecies to fit any possible future<br />
      state of affairs in our country. No matter what<br /> happens, you will
      find that somebody predicted it.<br /> If the city of London should lose
      her trade, if the<br /> Parliament house should become the abode of moles<br />
      and bats, if "the New Zealander should sit upon the<br /> "ruins of London
      Bridge," all these things would be<br /> simply the fulfillment of
      prophecy. The fall of every<br /> nation under the sun has been predicted
      by hundreds<br /> and thousands of people.<br /> <br /> The prophecies of the
      Old Testament can be made<br /> to fit anything that may happen, or that
      may not<br /> happen. They will apply to the death of a king, or<br /> to
      the destruction of a people,&mdash;to the loss of com-<br /> merce, or the
      discovery of a continent. Each pro-<br /> phecy is a jugglery of words, of
      figures, of symbols,<br /> so put together, so used, so interpreted, that
      they<br /> can mean anything, everything, or nothing.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do you see anything "prophetic" in<br /> the fate of the Jewish people
      themselves? Do you<br /> think that God made the Jewish people wanderers,
      so<br /> that they might be perpetual witnesses to the truth<br /> of the
      Scriptures?<br /> <br /> 286<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I cannot believe that
      an infinitely good<br /> God would make anybody a wanderer. Neither can<br />
      I believe that he would keep millions of people with-<br /> out country and
      without home, and allow them to be<br /> persecuted for thousands of years,
      simply that they<br /> might be used as witnesses. Nothing could be more<br />
      absurdly cruel than this.<br /> <br /> The Christians justify their
      treatment of the Jews<br /> on the ground that they are simply fulfilling
      prophecy.<br /> The Jews have suffered because of the horrid story<br />
      that their ancestors crucified the Son of God. Chris-<br /> tianity, coming
      into power, looked with horror upon<br /> the Jews, who denied the truth of
      the gospel. Each<br /> Jew was regarded as a dangerous witness against<br />
      Christianity. The early Christians saw how neces-<br /> sary it was that
      the people who lived in Jerusalem<br /> at the time of Christ should be
      convinced that<br /> he was God, and should testify to the miracles he<br />
      wrought. Whenever a Jew denied it, the Christian<br /> was filled with
      malignity and hatred, and immediately<br /> excited the prejudice of other
      Christians against the<br /> man simply because he was a Jew. They forgot,
      in<br /> their general hatred, that Mary, the mother of Christ,<br /> was a
      Jewess; that Christ himself was of Jewish<br /> blood; and with an
      inconsistency of which, of all<br /> <br /> 287<br /> <br /> religions,
      Christianity alone could have been guilty,<br /> the Jew became an object
      of especial hatred and<br /> aversion.<br /> <br /> When we remember that
      Christianity pretends to<br /> be a religion of love and kindness, of
      charity and for-<br /> giveness, must not every intelligent man be shocked<br />
      by the persecution of the Jews? Even now, in learned<br /> and cultivated
      Germany, the Jew is treated as though<br /> he were a wild beast. The
      reputation of this great<br /> people has been stained by a persecution
      spring-<br /> ing only from ignorance and barbarian prejudice.<br /> So in
      Russia, the Christians are anxious to shed<br /> every drop of Jewish
      blood, and thousands are to-day<br /> fleeing from their homes to seek a
      refuge from Chris-<br /> tian hate. And Mr. Talmage believes that all these<br />
      persecutions are kept up by the perpetual intervention<br /> of God, in
      order that the homeless wanderers of the<br /> seed of Abraham may testify
      to the truth of the Old<br /> and New Testaments. He thinks that every
      burning<br /> Jewish home sheds light upon the gospel,&mdash;that<br />
      every gash in Jewish flesh cries out in favor of the<br /> Bible,&mdash;that
      every violated Jewish maiden shows the<br /> interest that God still takes
      in the preservation of<br /> his Holy Word.<br /> <br /> I am endeavoring to
      do away with religious<br /> <br /> 288<br /> <br /> prejudice. I wish to
      substitute humanity for super-<br /> stition, the love of our fellow-men,
      for the fear of<br /> God. In the place of ignorant worship, let us put<br />
      good deeds. We should be great enough and grand<br /> enough to know that
      the rights of the Jew are pre-<br /> cisely the same as our own. We cannot
      trample<br /> upon their rights, without endangering our own; and<br /> no
      man who will take liberty from another, is great<br /> enough to enjoy
      liberty himself.<br /> <br /> Day by day Christians are laying the
      foundation<br /> of future persecution. In every Sunday school little<br />
      children are taught that Jews killed the God of this<br /> universe. Their
      little hearts are filled with hatred<br /> against the Jewish people. They
      are taught as a<br /> part of the creed to despise the descendants of the<br />
      only people with whom God is ever said to have had<br /> any conversation
      whatever.<br /> <br /> When we take into consideration what the Jewish<br />
      people have suffered, it is amazing that every one of<br /> them does not
      hate with all his heart and soul and<br /> strength the entire Christian
      world. But in spite of<br /> the persecutions they have endured, they are
      to-day,<br /> where they are permitted to enjoy reasonable liberty,<br />
      the most prosperous people on the globe. The idea<br /> that their
      condition shows, or tends to show, that<br /> <br /> 289<br /> <br /> upon
      them abides the wrath of Jehovah, cannot be<br /> substantiated by the
      facts.<br /> <br /> The Jews to-day control the commerce of the<br /> world.
      They control the money of the world. It is<br /> for them to say whether
      nations shall or shall not go<br /> to war. They are the people of whom
      nations borrow<br /> money. To their offices kings come with their hats<br />
      in their hands. Emperors beg them to discount their<br /> notes. Is all
      this a consequence of the wrath of<br /> God?<br /> <br /> We find upon our
      streets no Jewish beggars. It is<br /> a rare sight to find one of these
      people standing as<br /> a criminal before a court. They do not fill our
      alms-<br /> houses, nor our penitentiaries, nor our jails. In-<br />
      tellectually and morally they are the equal of any<br /> people. They have
      become illustrious in every de-<br /> partment of art and science. The old
      cry against<br /> them is at last perceived to be ignorant. Only a few<br />
      years ago, Christians would rob a Jew, strip him of<br /> his possessions,
      steal his money, declare him an out-<br /> cast, and drive him forth. Then
      they would point<br /> to him as a fulfillment of prophecy.<br /> <br /> If
      you wish to see the difference between some<br /> Jews and some Christians,
      compare the addresses of<br /> Felix Adler with the sermons of Mr. Talmage.<br />
      <br /> 290<br /> <br /> I cannot convince myself that an infinitely good<br />
      and wise God holds a Jewish babe in the cradle of<br /> to-day responsible
      for the crimes of Caiaphas the<br /> high priest. I hardly think that an
      infinitely good<br /> being would pursue this little babe through all its
      life<br /> simply to get revenge on those who died two thou-<br /> sand
      years ago. An infinite being ought certainly to<br /> know that the child
      is not to blame; and an infinite<br /> being who does not know this, is not
      entitled to the<br /> love or adoration of any honest man.<br /> <br /> There
      is a strange inconsistency in what Mr. Tal-<br /> mage says. For instance,
      he finds great fault with<br /> me because I do not agree with the
      religious ideas<br /> of my father; and he finds fault equally with the<br />
      Jews who do. The Jews who were true to the re-<br /> ligion of their
      fathers, according to Mr. Talmage,<br /> have been made a by-word and a
      hissing and a re-<br /> proach among all nations, and only those Jews were<br />
      fortunate and blest who abandoned the religion of<br /> their fathers. The
      real reason for this inconsistency<br /> is this: Mr. Talmage really thinks
      that a man can<br /> believe as he wishes. He imagines that evidence de-<br />
      pends simply upon volition; consequently, he holds<br /> every one
      responsible for his belief. Being satisfied<br /> that he has the exact
      truth in this matter, he meas-<br /> <br /> 291<br /> <br /> ures all other
      people by his standard, and if they<br /> fail by that measurement, he
      holds them personally<br /> responsible, and believes that his God does the
      same.<br /> If Mr. Talmage had been born in Turkey, he would<br /> in all
      probability have been a Mohammedan, and<br /> would now be denouncing some
      man who had denied<br /> the inspiration of the Koran, as the "champion
      blas-<br /> "phemer" of Constantinople. Certainly he would<br /> have been,
      had his parents been Mohammedans;<br /> because, according to his doctrine,
      he would have<br /> been utterly lacking in respect and love for his father<br />
      and mother had he failed to perpetuate their errors.<br /> So, had he been
      born in Utah, of Mormon parents,<br /> he would now have been a defender of
      polygamy.<br /> He would not "run the ploughshare of contempt<br /> "through
      the graves of his parents," by taking the<br /> ground that polygamy is
      wrong.<br /> <br /> I presume that all of Mr. Talmage's forefathers<br />
      were not Presbyterians. There must have been<br /> a time when one of his
      progenitors left the faith of<br /> his father, and joined the Presbyterian
      Church. Ac-<br /> cording to the reasoning of Mr. Talmage, that particular<br />
      progenitor was an exceedingly bad man; but had it<br /> not been for the
      crime of that bad man, Mr. Talmage<br /> might not now have been on the
      road to heaven.<br /> <br /> 292<br /> <br /> I hardly think that all the
      inventors, the thinkers,<br /> the philosophers, the discoverers,
      dishonored their<br /> parents. Fathers and mothers have been made<br />
      immortal by such sons. And yet these sons demon-<br /> strated the errors
      of their parents. A good father<br /> wishes to be excelled by his

      <br /> <big><b>SIXTH INTERVIEW.</b></big><br /> <br /> <i>It is a
      contradiction in terms and ideas to call<br /> anything a revelation that
      comes to us at second-<br /> hand, either verbally or in writing.
      Revelation is<br /> necessarily limited to the first communication&mdash;<br />
      after this, it is only an account of something<br /> which that person says
      was a revelation made to<br /> him; and though he may find himself obliged
      to<br /> believe it, it cannot be incumbent on me to<br /> believe it in the
      same manner; for it was not a<br /> revelation made to me, and I have only
      his word<br /> for it that it was made to him.&mdash;Thomas Paine.</i><br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. What do you think of the argu-<br /> ments presented
      by Mr. Talmage in favor of<br /> the inspiration of the Bible?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. Mr. Talmage takes the ground that<br /> there are more
      copies of the Bible than of any<br /> other book, and that consequently it
      must be in-<br /> spired.<br /> <br /> It seems to me that this kind of
      reasoning proves<br /> entirely too much. If the Bible is the inspired word<br />
      of God, it was certainly just as true when there was<br /> only one copy,
      as it is to-day; and the facts con-<br /> tained in it were just as true
      before they were<br /> <br /> 296<br /> <br /> written, as afterwards. We all
      know that it is a fact<br /> in human nature, that a man can tell a
      falsehood so<br /> often that he finally believes it himself; but I never<br />
      suspected, until now, that a mistake could be printed<br /> enough times to
      make it true.<br /> <br /> There may have been a time, and probably there<br />
      was, when there were more copies of the Koran<br /> than of the Bible. When
      most Christians were ut-<br /> terly ignorant, thousands of Moors were
      educated;<br /> and it is well known that the arts and sciences<br />
      flourished in Mohammedan countries in a far greater<br /> degree than in
      Christian. Now, at that time, it may<br /> be that there were more copies
      of the Koran than of<br /> the Bible. If some enterprising Mohammedan had<br />
      only seen the force of such a fact, he might have<br /> established the
      inspiration of the Koran beyond<br /> a doubt; or, if it had been found by
      actual count that<br /> the Koran was a little behind, a few years of in-<br />
      dustry spent in the multiplication of copies, might<br /> have furnished
      the evidence of its inspiration.<br /> <br /> Is it not simply amazing that
      a doctor of divinity,<br /> a Presbyterian clergyman, in this day and age,
      should<br /> seriously rely upon the number of copies of the Bible<br /> to
      substantiate the inspiration of that book? Is it<br /> possible to conceive
      of anything more fig-leaflessly<br /> <br /> 297<br /> <br /> absurd? If there
      is anything at all in this argument,<br /> it is, that all books are true
      in proportion to the<br /> number of copies that exist. Of course, the same<br />
      rule will work with newspapers; so that the news-<br /> paper having the
      largest circulation can consistently<br /> claim infallibility. Suppose
      that an exceedingly absurd<br /> statement should appear in <i>The New York
      Herald</i>,<br /> and some one should denounce it as utterly without<br />
      any foundation in fact or probability; what would<br /> Mr. Talmage think
      if the editor of the Herald, as an<br /> evidence of the truth of the
      statement, should rely<br /> on the fact that his paper had the largest
      circulation<br /> of any in the city? One would think that the whole<br />
      church had acted upon the theory that a falsehood re-<br /> peated often
      enough was as good as the truth.<br /> <br /> Another evidence brought
      forward by the reverend<br /> gentleman to prove the inspiration of the
      Scriptures,<br /> is the assertion that if Congress should undertake to<br />
      pass a law to take the Bible from the people, thirty,<br /> millions would
      rise in defence of that book.<br /> <br /> This argument also seems to me to
      prove too much,<br /> and as a consequence, to prove nothing. If Con-<br />
      gress should pass a law prohibiting the reading of<br /> Shakespeare, every
      American would rise in defence<br /> of his right to read the works of the
      greatest man<br /> <br /> 298<br /> <br /> this world has known. Still, that
      would not even<br /> tend to show that Shakespeare was inspired. The<br />
      fact is, the American people would not allow Con-<br /> gress to pass a law
      preventing them from reading<br /> any good book. Such action would not
      prove the<br /> book to be inspired; it would prove that the American<br />
      people believe in liberty.<br /> <br /> There are millions of people in
      Turkey who would<br /> peril their lives in defence of the Koran. A fact
      like<br /> this does not prove the truth of the Koran; it simply<br />
      proves what Mohammedans think of that book, and<br /> what they are willing
      to do for its preservation.<br /> <br /> It can not be too often repeated,
      that martyrdom<br /> does not prove the truth of the thing for which the<br />
      martyr dies; it only proves the sincerity of the martyr<br /> and the
      cruelty of his murderers. No matter how<br /> many people regard the Bible
      as inspired,&mdash;that fact<br /> furnishes no evidence that it is
      inspired. Just as many<br /> people have regarded other books as inspired;
      just as<br /> many millions have been deluded about the inspiration<br /> of
      books ages and ages before Christianity was born.<br /> <br /> The simple
      belief of one man, or of millions of men,<br /> is no evidence to another.
      Evidence must be based,<br /> not upon the belief of other people, but upon
      facts.<br /> A believer may state the facts upon which his belief<br />
      <br /> 299<br /> <br /> is founded, and the person to whom he states them<br />
      gives them the weight that according to the con-<br /> struction and
      constitution of his mind he must. But<br /> simple, bare belief is not
      testimony. We should build<br /> upon facts, not upon beliefs of others,
      nor upon the<br /> shifting sands of public opinion. So much for this<br />
      argument.<br /> <br /> The next point made by the reverend gentleman<br />
      is, that an infidel cannot be elected to any office in<br /> the United
      States, in any county, precinct, or ward.<br /> <br /> For the sake of the
      argument, let us admit that this<br /> is true. What does it prove? There
      was a time<br /> when no Protestant could have been elected to any<br />
      office. What did that prove? There was a time<br /> when no Presbyterian
      could have been chosen to fill<br /> any public station. What did that
      prove? The<br /> same may be said of the members of each religious<br />
      denomination. What does that prove?<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage says that
      Christianity must be true,<br /> because an infidel cannot be elected to
      office. Now,<br /> suppose that enough infidels should happen to settle<br />
      in one precinct to elect one of their own number to<br /> office; would
      that prove that Christianity was not<br /> true in that precinct? There was
      a time when no<br /> man could have been elected to any office, who in-<br />
      <br /> 300<br /> <br /> sisted on the rotundity of the earth; what did that<br />
      prove? There was a time when no man who denied<br /> the existence of
      witches, wizards, spooks and devils,<br /> could hold any position of
      honor; what did that<br /> prove? There was a time when an abolitionist
      could<br /> not be elected to office in any State in this Union;<br /> what
      did that prove? There was a time when they<br /> were not allowed to
      express their honest thoughts;<br /> what does that prove? There was a time
      when a<br /> Quaker could not have been elected to any office;<br /> there
      was a time in the history of this country when<br /> but few of them were
      allowed to live; what does<br /> that prove? Is it necessary, in order to
      ascertain the<br /> truth of Christianity, to look over the election re-<br />
      turns? Is "inspiration" a question to be settled by<br /> the ballot? I
      admit that it was once, in the first<br /> place, settled that way. I admit
      that books were<br /> voted in and voted out, and that the Bible was
      finally<br /> formed in accordance with a vote; but does Mr.<br /> Talmage
      insist that the question is not still open?<br /> Does he not know, that a
      fact cannot by any possi-<br /> bility be affected by opinion? We make laws
      for<br /> the whole people, by the whole people. We agree<br /> that a
      majority shall rule, but nobody ever pretended<br /> that a question of
      taste could be settled by an appeal<br /> <br /> 301<br /> <br /> to
      majorities, or that a question of logic could be<br /> affected by numbers.
      In the world of thought, each<br /> man is an absolute monarch, each brain
      is a king-<br /> dom, that cannot be invaded even by the tyranny of<br />
      majorities.<br /> <br /> No man can avoid the intellectual responsibility of<br />
      deciding for himself.<br /> <br /> Suppose that the Christian religion had
      been put<br /> to vote in Jerusalem? Suppose that the doctrine of<br /> the
      "fall" had been settled in Athens, by an appeal<br /> to the people, would
      Mr. Talmage have been willing<br /> to abide by their decision? If he
      settles the inspira-<br /> tion of the Bible by a popular vote, he must
      settle the<br /> meaning of the Bible by the same means. There are<br />
      more Methodists than Presbyterians&mdash;why does the<br /> gentleman
      remain a Presbyterian? There are more<br /> Buddhists than Christians&mdash;why
      does he vote against<br /> majorities? He will remember that Christianity
      was<br /> once settled by a popular vote&mdash;that the divinity of<br />
      Christ was submitted to the people, and the people<br /> said: "Crucify
      him!"<br /> <br /> The next, and about the strongest, argument Mr.<br />
      Talmage makes is, that I am an infidel because I was<br /> defeated for
      Governor of Illinois.<br /> <br /> When put in plain English, his statement
      is this:<br /> <br /> 302<br /> <br /> that I was defeated because I was an
      infidel, and that<br /> I am an infidel because I was defeated. This, I be-<br />
      lieve, is called reasoning in a circle. The truth is,<br /> that a good
      many people did object to me because I<br /> was an infidel, and the
      probability is, that if I had<br /> denied being an infidel, I might have
      obtained an<br /> office. The wonderful part is, that any Christian<br />
      should deride me because I preferred honor to po-<br /> litical success. He
      who dishonors himself for the<br /> sake of being honored by others, will
      find that two<br /> mistakes have been made&mdash;one by himself, and the<br />
      other, by the people.<br /> <br /> I presume that Mr.Talmage really thinks
      that I was<br /> extremely foolish to avow my real opinions. After<br />
      all, men are apt to judge others somewhat by them-<br /> selves. According
      to him, I made the mistake of<br /> preserving my manhood and losing an
      office. Now,<br /> if I had in fact been an infidel, and had denied it, for<br />
      the sake of position, then I admit that every Christian<br /> might have
      pointed at me the finger of contempt.<br /> But I was an infidel, and
      admitted it. Surely, I should<br /> not be held in contempt by Christians
      for having<br /> made the admission. I was not a believer in the<br />
      Bible, and I said so. I was not a Christian, and I said<br /> so. I was not
      willing to receive the support of any<br /> <br /> 303<br /> <br /> man under
      a false impression. I thought it better to<br /> be honestly beaten, than
      to dishonestly succeed.<br /> According to the ethics of Mr. Talmage I made
      a<br /> mistake, and this mistake is brought forward as<br /> another
      evidence of the inspiration of the Scriptures.<br /> If I had only been
      elected Governor of Illinois,&mdash;that<br /> is to say, if I had been a
      successful hypocrite, I might<br /> now be basking in the sunshine of this
      gentleman's<br /> respect. I preferred to tell the truth&mdash;to be an<br />
      honest man,&mdash;and I have never regretted the course<br /> I pursued.<br />
      <br /> There are many men now in office who, had they<br /> pursued a nobler
      course, would be private citizens.<br /> Nominally, they are Christians;
      actually, they are<br /> nothing; and this is the combination that
      generally<br /> insures political success.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage is
      exceedingly proud of the fact that<br /> Christians will not vote for
      infidels. In other words,<br /> he does not believe that in our Government
      the<br /> church has been absolutely divorced from the state.<br /> He
      believes that it is still the Christian's duty to<br /> make the religious
      test. Probably he wishes to get<br /> his God into the Constitution. My
      position is this:<br /> <br /> Religion is an individual matter&mdash;a
      something for<br /> each individual to settle for himself, and with which<br />
      <br /> 304<br /> <br /> no other human being has any concern, provided the<br />
      religion of each human being allows liberty to every<br /> other. When
      called upon to vote for men to fill the<br /> offices of this country, I do
      not inquire as to the re-<br /> ligion of the candidates. It is none of my
      business.<br /> I ask the questions asked by Jefferson: "Is he<br />
      "honest; is he capable?" It makes no difference to<br /> me, if he is
      willing that others should be free, what<br /> creed he may profess. The
      moment I inquire into his<br /> religious belief, I found a little
      inquisition of my own;<br /> I repeat, in a small way, the errors of the
      past, and<br /> reproduce, in so far as I am capable, the infamy of<br />
      the ignorant orthodox years.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage will accept my thanks
      for his frankness.<br /> I now know what controls a Presbyterian when he<br />
      casts his vote. He cares nothing for the capacity,<br /> nothing for the
      fitness, of the candidate to discharge<br /> the duties of the office to
      which he aspires; he<br /> simply asks: Is he a Presbyterian, is he a
      Protestant,<br /> does he believe our creed? and then, no matter how<br />
      ignorant he may be, how utterly unfit, he receives the<br /> Presbyterian
      vote. According to Mr. Talmage, he<br /> would vote for a Catholic who, if
      he had the power,<br /> would destroy all liberty of conscience, rather
      than<br /> vote for an infidel who, had he the power, would<br /> <br /> 305<br />
      <br /> destroy all the religious tyranny of the world, and<br /> allow every
      human being to think for himself, and<br /> to worship God, or not, as and
      how he pleased.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage makes the serious mistake of
      placing<br /> the Bible above the laws and Constitution of his<br />
      country. He places Jehovah above humanity. Such<br /> men are not entirely
      safe citizens of any republic.<br /> And yet, I am in favor of giving to
      such men all the<br /> liberty I ask for myself, trusting to education and
      the<br /> spirit of progress to overcome any injury they may<br /> do, or
      seek to do.<br /> <br /> When this country was founded, when the Con-<br />
      stitution was adopted, the churches agreed to let the<br /> State alone.
      They agreed that all citizens should have<br /> equal civil rights. Nothing
      could be more dangerous<br /> to the existence of this Republic than to
      introduce<br /> religion into politics. The American theory is, that<br />
      governments are founded, not by gods, but by men,<br /> and that the right
      to govern does not come from<br /> God, but "from the consent of the
      governed." Our<br /> fathers concluded that the people were sufficiently<br />
      intelligent to take care of themselves&mdash;to make good<br /> laws and to
      execute them. Prior to that time, all<br /> authority was supposed to come
      from the clouds.<br /> Kings were set upon thrones by God, and it was the<br />
      <br /> 306<br /> <br /> business of the people simply to submit. In all
      really<br /> civilized countries, that doctrine has been abandoned.<br />
      The source of political power is here, not in heaven.<br /> We are willing
      that those in heaven should control<br /> affairs there; we are willing
      that the angels should<br /> have a government to suit themselves; but
      while we<br /> live here, and while our interests are upon this earth,<br />
      we propose to make and execute our own laws.<br /> <br /> If the doctrine of
      Mr. Talmage is the true doctrine,<br /> if no man should be voted for
      unless he is a Christian,<br /> then no man should vote unless he is a
      Christian. It<br /> will not do to say that sinners may vote, that an
      infidel<br /> may be the repository of political power, but must not<br />
      be voted for. A decent Christian who is not willing<br /> that an infidel
      should be elected to an office, would<br /> not be willing to be elected to
      an office by infidel<br /> votes. If infidels are too bad to be voted for,
      they<br /> are certainly not good enough to vote, and no<br /> Christian
      should be willing to represent such an<br /> infamous constituency.<br />
      <br /> If the political theory of Mr. Talmage is carried<br /> out, of
      course the question will arise in a little while,<br /> What is a
      Christian? It will then be necessary to<br /> write a creed to be
      subscribed by every person before<br /> he is fit to vote or to be voted
      for. This of course<br /> <br /> 307<br /> <br /> must be done by the State,
      and must be settled,<br /> under our form of government, by a majority
      vote.<br /> Is Mr. Talmage willing that the question, What is<br />
      Christianity? should be so settled? Will he pledge<br /> himself in advance
      to subscribe to such a creed? Of<br /> course he will not. He will insist
      that he has the<br /> right to read the Bible for himself, and that he must<br />
      be bound by his own conscience. In this he would<br /> be right. If he has
      the right to read the Bible for<br /> himself, so have I. If he is to be
      bound by his con-<br /> science, so am I. If he honestly believes the Bible
      to<br /> be true, he must say so, in order to preserve his man-<br /> hood;
      and if I honestly believe it to be uninspired,&mdash;<br /> filled with
      mistakes,&mdash;I must say so, or lose my man-<br /> hood. How infamous I
      would be should I endeavor<br /> to deprive him of his vote, or of his
      right to be voted<br /> for, because he had been true to his conscience!
      And<br /> how infamous he is to try to deprive me of the right<br /> to
      vote, or to be voted for, because I am true to my<br /> conscience!<br />
      <br /> When we were engaged in civil war, did Mr. Tal-<br /> mage object to
      any man's enlisting in the ranks who<br /> was not a Christian? Was he
      willing, at that time,<br /> that sinners should vote to keep our flag in
      heaven?<br /> Was he willing that the "unconverted" should cover<br /> <br />
      308<br /> <br /> the fields of victory with their corpses, that this nation<br />
      might not die? At the same time, Mr. Talmage<br /> knew that every
      "unconverted" soldier killed, went<br /> down to eternal fire. Does Mr.
      Talmage believe that<br /> it is the duty of a man to fight for a
      government in<br /> which he has no rights? Is the man who shoulders<br />
      his musket in the defence of human freedom good<br /> enough to cast a
      ballot? There is in the heart of this<br /> priest the safne hatred of real
      liberty that drew the<br /> sword of persecution, that built dungeons, that
      forged<br /> chains and made instruments of torture.<br /> <br /> Nobody,
      with the exception of priests, would be<br /> willing to trust the
      liberties of this country in the<br /> hands of any church. In order to
      show the political<br /> estimation in which the clergy are held, in order
      to<br /> show the confidence the people at large have in the<br /> sincerity
      and wisdom of the clergy, it is sufficient to<br /> state, that no priest,
      no bishop, could by any possi-<br /> bility be elected President of the
      United States. No<br /> party could carry that load. A fear would fall upon<br />
      the mind and heart of every honest man that this<br /> country was about to
      drift back to the Middle Ages,<br /> and that the old battles were to be
      refought. If the<br /> bishop running for President was of the Methodist<br />
      Church, every other church would oppose him. If<br /> <br /> 309<br /> <br />
      he was a Catholic, the Protestants would as a body<br /> combine against
      him. Why? The churches have<br /> no confidence in each other. Why? Because
      they<br /> are acquainted with each other.<br /> <br /> As a matter of fact,
      the infidel has a thousand<br /> times more reason to vote against the
      Christian,<br /> than the Christian has to vote against the infidel.<br />
      The Christian believes in a book superior to the<br /> Constitution&mdash;superior
      to all Constitutions and all<br /> laws. The infidel believes that the
      Constitution and<br /> laws are superior to any book. He is not controlled<br />
      by any power beyond the seas or above the clouds.<br /> He does not receive
      his orders from Rome, or Sinai.<br /> He receives them from his
      fellow-citizens, legally and<br /> constitutionally expressed. The
      Christian believes in<br /> a power greater than man, to which, upon the
      peril<br /> of eternal pain, he must bow. His allegiance, to say<br /> the
      best of it, is divided. The Christian puts the for-<br /> tune of his own
      soul over and above the temporal<br /> welfare of the entire world; the
      infidel puts the good<br /> of mankind here and now, beyond and over all.<br />
      <br /> There was a time in New England when only<br /> church members were
      allowed to vote, and it may be<br /> instructive to state the fact that
      during that time<br /> Quakers were hanged, women were stripped, tied to<br />
      <br /> 310<br /> <br /> carts, and whipped from town to town, and their<br />
      babes sold into slavery, or exchanged for rum. Now<br /> in that same
      country, thousands and thousands of<br /> infidels vote, and yet the laws
      are nearer just, women<br /> are not whipped and children are not sold.<br />
      <br /> If all the convicts in all the penitentiaries of the<br /> United
      States could be transported to some island in<br /> the sea, and there
      allowed to make a government for<br /> themselves, they would pass better
      laws than John<br /> Calvin did in Geneva. They would have clearer and<br />
      better views of the rights of men, than unconvicted<br /> Christians used
      to have. I do not say that these<br /> convicts are better people, but I do
      say that, in my<br /> judgment, they would make better laws. They cer-<br />
      tainly could not make worse.<br /> <br /> If these convicts were taken from
      the prisons of<br /> the United States, they would not dream of uniting<br />
      church and state. They would have no religious<br /> test. They would allow
      every man to vote and to be<br /> voted for, no matter what his religious
      views might<br /> be. They would not dream of whipping Quakers, of<br />
      burning Unitarians, of imprisoning or burning Uni-<br /> versalists or
      infidels. They would allow all the people<br /> to guess for themselves.
      Some of these convicts, of<br /> course, would believe in the old ideas,
      and would<br /> insist upon the suppression of free thought. Those<br />
      coming from Delaware would probably repeat with<br /> great gusto the
      opinions of Justice Comegys, and<br /> insist that the whipping-post was
      the handmaid of<br /> Christianity.<br /> <br /> It would be hard to conceive
      of a much worse<br /> government than that founded by the Puritans.<br />
      They took the Bible for the foundation of their<br /> political structure.
      They copied the laws given to<br /> Moses from Sinai, and the result was
      one of the<br /> worst governments that ever disgraced this world.<br />
      They believed the Old Testament to be inspired.<br /> They believed that
      Jehovah made laws for all people<br /> and for all time. They had not
      learned the hypoc-<br /> risy that believes and avoids. They did not say:<br />
      This law was once just, but is now unjust; it was<br /> once good, but now
      it is infamous; it was given by<br /> God once, but now it can only be
      obeyed by the<br /> devil. They had not reached the height of biblical<br />
      exegesis on which we find the modern theologian<br /> perched, and who
      tells us that Jehovah has reformed.<br /> The Puritans were consistent.
      They did what people<br /> must do who honestly believe in the inspiration
      of<br /> the Old Testament. If God gave laws from Sinai<br /> what right
      have we to repeal them?<br /> <br /> 312<br /> <br /> As people have gained
      confidence in each other,<br /> they have lost confidence in the sacred
      Scriptures.<br /> We know now that the Bible can not be used as the<br />
      foundation of government. It is capable of too many<br /> meanings. Nobody
      can find out exactly what it<br /> upholds, what it permits, what it
      denounces, what it<br /> denies. These things depend upon what part you<br />
      read. If it is all true, it upholds everything bad and<br /> denounces
      everything good, and it also denounces<br /> the bad and upholds the good.
      Then there are<br /> passages where the good is denounced and the bad<br />
      commanded; so that any one can go to the Bible<br /> and find some text,
      some passage, to uphold anything<br /> he may desire. If he wishes to
      enslave his fellow-<br /> men, he will find hundreds of passages in his
      favor.<br /> If he wishes to be a polygamist, he can find his<br />
      authority there. If he wishes to make war, to exter-<br /> minate his
      neighbors, there his warrant can be found.<br /> If, on the other hand, he
      is oppressed himself, and<br /> wishes to make war upon his king, he can
      find a<br /> battle-cry. And if the king wishes to put him down,<br /> he
      can find text for text on the other side. So, too,<br /> upon all questions
      of reform. The teetotaler goes<br /> there to get his verse, and the
      moderate drinker<br /> finds within the sacred lids his best excuse.<br />
      <br /> 313<br /> <br /> Most intelligent people are now convinced that the<br />
      bible is not a guide; that in reading it you must<br /> exercise your
      reason; that you can neither safely<br /> reject nor accept all; that he
      who takes one passage<br /> for a staff, trips upon another; that while one
      text is<br /> a light, another blows it out; that it is such a ming-<br />
      ling of rocks and quicksands, such a labyrinth of<br /> clews and snares&mdash;so
      few flowers among so many<br /> nettles and thorns, that it misleads rather
      than di-<br /> rects, and taken altogether, is a hindrance and not<br /> a
      help.<br /> <br /> Another important point made by Mr. Talmage is,<br /> that
      if the Bible is thrown away, we will have nothing<br /> left to swear
      witnesses on, and that consequently the<br /> administration of justice
      will become impossible.<br /> <br /> There was a time when the Bible did not
      exist, and<br /> if Mr. Talmage is correct, of course justice was im-<br />
      possible then, and truth must have been a stranger<br /> to human lips. How
      can we depend upon the testi-<br /> mony of those who wrote the Bible, as
      there was no<br /> Bible in existence while they were writing, and con-<br />
      sequently there was no way to take their testimony,<br /> and we have no
      account of their having been sworn<br /> on the Bible after they got it
      finished. It is extremely<br /> sad to think that all the nations of
      antiquity were left<br /> <br /> 314<br /> <br /> entirely without the means
      of eliciting truth. No<br /> wonder that Justice was painted blindfolded.<br />
      <br /> What perfect fetichism it is, to imagine that a man<br /> will tell
      the truth simply because he has kissed an<br /> old piece of sheepskin
      stained with the saliva of all<br /> classes. A farce of this kind adds
      nothing to the<br /> testimony of an honest man; it simply allows a rogue<br />
      to give weight to his false testimony. This is really<br /> the only result
      that can be accomplished by kissing<br /> the Bible. A desperate villain,
      for the purpose of<br /> getting revenge, or making money, will gladly go<br />
      through the ceremony, and ignorant juries and su-<br /> perstitious judges
      will be imposed upon. The whole<br /> system of oaths is false, and does
      harm instead of<br /> good. Let every man walk into court and tell his<br />
      story, and let the truth of the story be judged by its<br />
      reasonableness, taking into consideration the charac-<br /> ter of the
      witness, the interest he has, and the posi-<br /> tion he occupies in the
      controversy, and then let it<br /> be the business of the jury to ascertain
      the real truth<br /> &mdash;to throw away the unreasonable and the impossi-<br />
      ble, and make up their verdict only upon what they<br /> believe to be
      reasonable and true. An honest man<br /> does not need the oath, and a
      rascal uses it simply<br /> to accomplish his purpose. If the history of
      courts<br /> <br /> 315<br /> <br /> proved that every man, after kissing the
      Bible, told<br /> the truth, and that those who failed to kiss it some-<br />
      times lied, I should be in favor of swearing all people<br /> on the Bible;
      but the experience of every lawyer is,<br /> that kissing the Bible is not
      always the preface of a<br /> true story. It is often the ceremonial
      embroidery<br /> of a falsehood.<br /> <br /> If there is an infinite God who
      attends to the<br /> affairs of men, it seems to me almost a sacrilege to<br />
      publicly appeal to him in every petty trial. If one<br /> will go into any
      court, and notice the manner in<br /> which oaths are administered,&mdash;the
      utter lack of<br /> solemnity&mdash;the matter-of-course air with which the<br />
      whole thing is done, he will be convinced that it is a<br /> form of no
      importance. Mr. Talmage would probably<br /> agree with the judge of whom
      the following story is<br /> told:<br /> <br /> A witness was being sworn.
      The judge noticed<br /> that he was not holding up his hand. He said to the<br />
      clerk: "Let the witness hold up his right hand."<br /> "His right arm was
      shot off," replied the clerk. "Let<br /> "him hold up his left, then."
      "That was shot off, too,<br /> "your honor." "Well, then, let him raise one
      foot;<br /> "no man can be sworn in this court without holding<br />
      "something up."<br /> <br /> <br /> My own opinion is, that if every copy of
      the Bible<br /> in the world were destroyed, there would be some<br /> way
      to ascertain the truth in judicial proceedings;<br /> and any other book
      would do just as well to swear<br /> witnesses upon, or a block in the
      shape of a book<br /> covered with some kind of calfskin could do equally<br />
      well, or just the calfskin would do. Nothing is more<br /> laughable than
      the performance of this ceremony,<br /> and I have never seen in court one
      calf kissing the<br /> skin of another, that I did not feel humiliated that<br />
      such things were done in the name of Justice.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage has
      still another argument in favor<br /> of the preservation of the Bible. He
      wants to<br /> know what book could take its place on the centre-<br />
      table.<br /> <br /> I admit that there is much force in this. Suppose<br />
      we all admitted the Bible to be an uninspired book,<br /> it could still be
      kept on the centre-table. It would<br /> be just as true then as it is now.
      Inspiration can not<br /> add anything to a fact; neither can inspiration
      make<br /> the immoral moral, the unjust just, or the cruel merci-<br />
      ful. If it is a fact that God established human slavery,<br /> that does
      not prove slavery to be right; it simply<br /> shows that God was wrong. If
      I have the right to<br /> use my reason in determining whether the Bible is<br />
      <br /> 317<br /> <br /> inspired or not, and if in accordance with my reason<br />
      I conclude that it is inspired, I have still the right to<br /> use my
      reason in determining whether the command-<br /> ments of God are good or
      bad. Now, suppose we<br /> take from the Bible every word upholding
      slavery,<br /> every passage in favor of polygamy, every verse<br />
      commanding soldiers to kill women and children, it<br /> would be just as
      fit for the centre-table as now. Sup-<br /> pose every impure word was
      taken from it; suppose<br /> that the history of Tamar was left out, the
      biography<br /> of Lot, and all other barbarous accounts of a barbarous<br />
      people, it would look just as well upon the centre-<br /> table as now.<br />
      <br /> Suppose that we should become convinced that<br /> the writers of the
      New Testament were mistaken as<br /> to the eternity of punishment, or that
      all the passages<br /> now relied upon to prove the existence of perdition<br />
      were shown to be interpolations, and were thereupon<br /> expunged, would
      not the book be dearer still to<br /> every human being with a heart? I
      would like to<br /> see every good passage in the Bible preserved. I<br />
      would like to see, with all these passages from the<br /> Bible, the
      loftiest sentiments from all other books<br /> that have ever been uttered
      by men in all ages and<br /> of all races, bound in one volume, and to see
      that<br /> <br /> 318<br /> <br /> volume, filled with the greatest, the
      purest and the<br /> best, become the household book.<br /> <br /> The
      average Bible, on the average centre-table, is<br /> about as much used as
      though it were a solid block.<br /> It is scarcely ever opened, and people
      who see its<br /> covers every day are unfamiliar with its every page.<br />
      <br /> I admit that some things have happened some-<br /> what hard to
      explain, and tending to show that the<br /> Bible is no ordinary book. I
      heard a story, not long<br /> ago, bearing upon this very subject.<br />
      <br /> A man was a member of the church, but after a<br /> time, having had
      bad luck in business affairs, became<br /> somewhat discouraged. Not
      feeling able to con-<br /> tribute his share to the support of the church,
      he<br /> ceased going to meeting, and finally became an<br /> average
      sinner. His bad luck pursued him until he<br /> found himself and his
      family without even a crust to<br /> eat. At this point, his wife told him
      that she be-<br /> lieved they were suffering from a visitation of God,<br />
      and begged him to restore family worship, and see if<br /> God would not do
      something for them. Feeling that<br /> he could not possibly make matters
      worse, he took<br /> the Bible from its resting place on a shelf where<br />
      it had quietly slumbered and collected the dust of<br /> many months, and
      gathered his family about him.<br /> <br /> 319<br /> <br /> He opened the
      sacred volume, and to his utter as-<br /> tonishment, there, between the
      divine leaves, was a<br /> ten-dollar bill. He immediately dropped on his<br />
      knees. His wife dropped on hers, and the children on<br /> theirs, and with
      streaming eyes they returned thanks<br /> to God. He rushed to the
      butcher's and bought<br /> some steak, to the baker's and bought some
      bread,<br /> to the grocer's and got some eggs and butter and tea,<br /> and
      joyfully hastened home. The supper was cooked,<br /> it was on the table,
      grace was said, and every face<br /> was radiant with joy. Just at that
      happy moment a<br /> knock was heard, the door was opened, and a police-<br />
      man entered and arrested the father for passing<br /> counterfeit money.<br />
      <br /> Mr. Talmage is also convinced that the Bible is<br /> inspired and
      should be preserved because there is no<br /> other book that &agrave;
      mother could give her son as he<br /> leaves the old home to make his way
      in the world.<br /> <br /> Thousands and thousands of mothers have pre-<br />
      sented their sons with Bibles without knowing really<br /> what the book
      contains. They simply followed the<br /> custom, and the sons as a rule
      honored the Bible, not<br /> because they knew anything of it, but because
      it was<br /> a gift from mother. But surely, if all the passages<br />
      upholding polygamy were out, the mother would give<br /> <br /> 320<br />
      <br /> the book to her son just as readily, and he would re-<br /> ceive it
      just as joyfully. If there were not one word<br /> in it tending to degrade
      the mother, the gift would cer-<br /> tainly be as appropriate. The fact
      that mothers have<br /> presented Bibles to their sons does not prove that
      the<br /> book is inspired. The most that can be proved by<br /> this fact
      is that the mothers believed it to be inspired.<br /> It does not even tend
      to show what the book is,<br /> neither does it tend to establish the truth
      of one<br /> miracle recorded upon its pages. We cannot believe<br /> that
      fire refused to burn, simply because the state-<br /> ment happens to be in
      a book presented to a son by<br /> his mother, and if all the mothers of
      the entire world<br /> should give Bibles to all their children, this would
      not<br /> prove that it was once right to murder mothers, or to<br />
      enslave mothers, or to sell their babes.<br /> <br /> The inspiration of the
      Bible is not a question of<br /> natural affection. It can not be decided
      by the love<br /> a mother bears her son. It is a question of fact, to<br />
      be substantiated like other facts. If the Turkish<br /> mother should give
      a copy of the Koran to her<br /> son, I would still have my doubts about
      the in-<br /> spiration of that book; and if some Turkish soldier<br />
      saved his life by having in his pocket a copy of<br /> the Koran that
      accidentally stopped a bullet just<br /> <br /> 321<br /> <br /> opposite his
      heart, I should still deny that Mohammed<br /> was a prophet of God.<br />
      <br /> Nothing can be more childish than to ascribe<br /> mysterious powers
      to inanimate objects. To imagine<br /> that old rags made into pulp,
      manufactured into<br /> paper, covered with words, and bound with the skin<br />
      of a calf or a sheep, can have any virtues when thus<br /> put together
      that did not belong to the articles out<br /> of which the book was
      constructed, is of course<br /> infinitely absurd.<br /> <br /> In the days
      of slavery, negroes used to buy dried<br /> roots of other negroes, and put
      these roots in their<br /> pockets, so that a whipping would not give them<br />
      pain. Kings have bought diamonds to give them<br /> luck. Crosses and
      scapularies are still worn for the<br /> purpose of affecting the
      inevitable march of events.<br /> People still imagine that a verse in the
      Bible can step<br /> in between a cause and its effect; really believe that<br />
      an amulet, a charm, the bone of some saint, a piece<br /> of a cross, a
      little image of the Virgin, a picture of a<br /> priest, will affect the
      weather, will delay frost, will<br /> prevent disease, will insure safety
      at sea, and in some<br /> cases prevent hanging. The banditti of Italy have<br />
      great confidence in these things, and whenever they<br /> start upon an
      expedition of theft and plunder, they<br /> <br /> 322<br /> <br /> take
      images and pictures of saints with them, such<br /> as have been blest by a
      priest or pope. They pray<br /> sincerely to the Virgin, to give them luck,
      and see not<br /> the slightest inconsistency in appealing to all the<br />
      saints in the calendar to assist them in robbing honest<br /> people.<br />
      <br /> Edmund About tells a story that illustrates the belief<br /> of the
      modern Italian. A young man was gambling.<br /> Fortune was against him. In
      the room was a little<br /> picture representing the Virgin and her child.
      Before<br /> this picture he crossed himself, and asked the assist-<br />
      ance of the child. Again he put down his money<br /> and again lost.
      Returning to the picture, he told the<br /> child that he had lost all but
      one piece, that he was<br /> about to hazard that, and made a very urgent
      request<br /> that he would favor him with divine assistance. He<br /> put
      down the last piece. He lost. Going to the<br /> picture and shaking his
      fist at the child, he cried out:<br /> "Miserable bambino, I am glad they
      crucified you!"<br /> <br /> The confidence that one has in an image, in a
      relic,<br /> in a book, comes from the same source,&mdash;fetichism.<br />
      To ascribe supernatural virtues to the skin of a snake,<br /> to a picture,
      or to a bound volume, is intellectually<br /> the same.<br /> <br /> Mr.
      Talmage has still another argument in favor<br /> <br /> 323<br /> <br /> of
      the inspiration of the Scriptures. He takes the<br /> ground that the Bible
      must be inspired, because so<br /> many people believe it.<br /> <br /> Mr.
      Talmage should remember that a scientific<br /> fact does not depend upon
      the vote of numbers;&mdash;<br /> it depends simply upon demonstration; it
      depends<br /> upon intelligence and investigation, not upon an<br />
      ignorant multitude; it appeals to the highest, in-<br /> stead of to the
      lowest. Nothing can be settled<br /> by popular prejudice.<br /> <br />
      According to Mr. Talmage, there are about three<br /> hundred million
      Christians in the world. Is this true?<br /> In all countries claiming to
      be Christian&mdash;including<br /> all of civilized Europe, Russia in Asia,
      and every<br /> country on the Western hemisphere, we have nearly<br /> four
      hundred millions of people. Mr. Talmage claims<br /> that three hundred
      millions are Christians. I sup-<br /> pose he means by this, that if all
      should perish to-<br /> night, about three hundred millions would wake up<br />
      in heaven&mdash;having lived and died good and consist-<br /> ent
      Christians.<br /> <br /> There are in Russia about eighty millions of people<br />
      &mdash;how many Christians? I admit that they have re-<br /> cently given
      more evidence of orthodox Christianity<br /> than formerly. They have been
      murdering old men;<br /> <br /> 324<br /> <br /> they have thrust daggers into
      the breasts of women;<br /> they have violated maidens&mdash;because they
      were Jews.<br /> Thousands and thousands are sent each year to the<br />
      mines of Siberia, by the Christian government of<br /> Russia. Girls
      eighteen years of age, for having ex-<br /> pressed a word in favor of
      human liberty, are to-day<br /> working like beasts of burden, with chains
      upon<br /> their limbs and with the marks of whips upon<br /> their backs.
      Russia, of course, is considered by Mr.<br /> Talmage as a Christian
      country&mdash;a country utterly<br /> destitute of liberty&mdash;without
      freedom of the press,<br /> without freedom of speech, where every mouth is<br />
      locked and every tongue a prisoner&mdash;a country filled<br /> with
      victims, soldiers, spies, thieves and executioners.<br /> What would Russia
      be, in the opinion of Mr. Tal-<br /> mage, but for Christianity? How could
      it be worse,<br /> when assassins are among the best people in it?<br /> The
      truth is, that the people in Russia, to-day, who<br /> are in favor of
      human liberty, are not Christians.<br /> The men willing to sacrifice their
      lives for the good<br /> of others, are not believers in the Christian
      religion.<br /> The men who wish to break chains are infidels;<br /> the men
      who make chains are Christians. Every<br /> good and sincere Catholic of
      the Greek Church<br /> is a bad citizen, an enemy of progress, a foe of<br />
      <br /> 325<br /> <br /> human liberty. Yet Mr. Talmage regards Russia<br /> as
      a Christian country.<br /> <br /> The sixteen millions of people in Spain
      are claimed<br /> as Christians. Spain, that for centuries was the as-<br />
      sassin of human rights; Spain, that endeavored to<br /> spread Christianity
      by flame and fagot; Spain, the<br /> soil where the Inquisition flourished,
      where bigotry<br /> grew, and where cruelty was worship,&mdash;where<br />
      murder was prayer. I admit that Spain is a Chris-<br /> tian nation. I
      admit that infidelity has gained no<br /> foothold beyond the Pyrenees. The
      Spaniards are<br /> orthodox. They believe in the inspiration of the<br />
      Old and New Testaments. They have no doubts<br /> about miracles&mdash;no
      doubts about heaven, no doubts<br /> about hell. I admit that the priests,
      the highway-<br /> men, the bishops and thieves, are equally true be-<br />
      lievers. The man who takes your purse on the<br /> highway, and the priest
      who forgives the robber,<br /> are alike orthodox.<br /> <br /> It gives me
      pleasure, however, to say that even in<br /> Spain there is a dawn. Some
      great men, some men<br /> of genius, are protesting against the tyranny of
      Cath-<br /> olicism. Some men have lost confidence in the<br /> cathedral,
      and are beginningto ask the State to erect<br /> the schoolhouse. They are
      beginning to suspect<br /> <br /> 326<br /> <br /> that priests are for the
      most part impostors and<br /> plunderers.<br /> <br /> According to Mr.
      Talmage, the twenty-eight mil-<br /> lions in Italy are Christians. There
      the Christian<br /> Church was early established, and the popes are to-<br />
      day the successors of St. Peter. For hundreds and<br /> hundreds of years,
      Italy was the beggar of the world,<br /> and to her, from every land,
      flowed streams of gold<br /> and silver. The country was covered with
      convents,<br /> and monasteries, and churches, and cathedrals filled<br />
      with monks and nuns. Its roads were crowded with<br /> pilgrims, and its
      dust was on the feet of the world.<br /> What has Christianity done for
      Italy&mdash;Italy, its soil a<br /> blessing, its sky a smile&mdash;Italy,
      with memories great<br /> enough to kindle the fires of enthusiasm in any<br />
      human breast?<br /> <br /> Had it not been for a few Freethinkers, for a few<br />
      infidels, for such men as Garibaldi and Mazzini, the<br /> heaven of Italy
      would still have been without a star.<br /> <br /> I admit that Italy, with
      its popes and bandits, with<br /> its superstition and ignorance, with its
      sanctified<br /> beggars, is a Christian nation; but in a little while,&mdash;<br />
      in a few days,&mdash;when according to the prophecy of<br /> Garibaldi
      priests, with spades in their hands, will<br /> dig ditches to drain the
      Pontine marshes; in a little<br /> <br /> 327<br /> <br /> while, when the
      pope leaves the Vatican, and seeks<br /> the protection of a nation he has
      denounced,&mdash;asking<br /> alms of intended victims; when the nuns shall
      marry,<br /> and the monasteries shall become factories, and the<br /> whirl
      of wheels shall take the place of drowsy prayers<br /> &mdash;then, and not
      until then, will Italy be,&mdash;not a<br /> Christian nation, but great,
      prosperous, and free.<br /> <br /> In Italy, Giordano Bruno was burned. Some
      day,<br /> his monument will rise above the cross of Rome.<br /> <br /> We
      have in our day one example,&mdash;and so far as I<br /> know, history
      records no other,&mdash;of the resurrection<br /> of a nation. Italy has
      been called from the grave of<br /> superstition. She is "the first fruits
      of them that<br /> "slept."<br /> <br /> I admit with Mr. Talmage that
      Portugal is a Chris-<br /> tian country&mdash;that she engaged for hundreds
      of years<br /> in the slave trade, and that she justified the infamous<br />
      traffic by passages in the Old Testament. I admit,<br /> also, that she
      persecuted the Jews in accordance<br /> with the same divine volume. I
      admit that all the<br /> crime, ignorance, destitution, and superstition in
      that<br /> country were produced by the Catholic Church. I<br /> also admit
      that Portugal would be better if it were<br /> Protestant.<br /> <br /> Every
      Catholic is in favor of education enough to<br /> <br /> 328<br /> <br />
      change a barbarian into a Catholic; every Protestant<br /> is in favor of
      education enough to change a Catholic<br /> into a Protestant; but
      Protestants and Catholics alike<br /> are opposed to education that will
      lead to any<br /> real philosophy and science. I admit that Portugal<br />
      is what it is, on account of the preaching of the<br /> gospel. I admit
      that Portugal can point with pride<br /> to the triumphs of what she calls
      civilization within<br /> her borders, and truthfully ascribe the glory to
      the<br /> church. But in a litde while, when more railroads<br /> are built,
      when telegraphs connect her people with<br /> the civilized world, a spirit
      of doubt, of investigation,<br /> will manifest itself in Portugal.<br />
      <br /> When the people stop counting beads, and go to<br /> the study of
      mathematics; when they think more of<br /> plows than of prayers for
      agricultural purposes; when<br /> they find that one fact gives more light
      to the mind<br /> than a thousand tapers, and that nothing can by any<br />
      possibility be more useless than a priest,&mdash;then Por-<br /> tugal will
      begin to cease to be what is called a<br /> Christian nation.<br /> <br /> I
      admit that Austria, with her thirty-seven millions,<br /> is a Christian
      nation&mdash;including her Croats, Hungar-<br /> ians, Servians, and
      Gypsies. Austria was one of the<br /> assassins of Poland. When we remember
      that John<br /> <br /> 329<br /> <br /> Sobieski drove the Mohammedans from
      the gates of<br /> Vienna, and rescued from the hand of the "infidel"<br />
      the beleagured city, the propriety of calling Austria a<br /> Christian
      nation becomes still more apparent. If one<br /> wishes to know exactly how
      "Christian" Austria is,<br /> let him read the history of Hungary, let him
      read<br /> the speeches of Kossuth. There is one good thing<br /> about
      Austria: slowly but surely she is undermining<br /> the church by
      education. Education is the enemy<br /> of superstition. Universal
      education does away with<br /> the classes born of the tyranny of
      ecclesiasticism&mdash;<br /> classes founded upon cunning, greed, and brute<br />
      strength. Education also tends to do away with<br /> intellectual
      cowardice. The educated man is his<br /> own priest, his own pope, his own
      church.<br /> <br /> When cunning collects tolls from fear, the church<br />
      prospers.<br /> <br /> Germany is another Christian nation. Bismarck is<br />
      celebrated for his Christian virtues.<br /> <br /> Only a little while ago,
      Bismarck, when a bill was<br /> under consideration for ameliorating the
      condition<br /> of the Jews, stated publicly that Germany was a<br />
      Christian nation, that her business was to extend<br /> and protect the
      religion of Jesus Christ, and that<br /> being a Christian nation, no laws
      should be passed<br /> <br /> 330<br /> <br /> ameliorating the condition of
      the Jews. Certainly a<br /> remark like this could not have been made in
      any<br /> other than a Christian nation. There is no freedom<br /> of the
      press, there is no freedom of speech, in Ger-<br /> many. The Chancellor
      has gone so far as to declare<br /> that the king is not responsible to the
      people. Ger-<br /> many must be a Christian nation. The king gets his<br />
      right to govern, not from his subjects, but from God.<br /> He relies upon
      the New Testament. He is satisfied<br /> that "the powers that be in
      Germany are ordained<br /> "of God." He is satisfied that treason against
      the<br /> German throne is treason against Jehovah. There<br /> are millions
      of Freethinkers in Germany. They are<br /> not in the majority, otherwise
      there would be more<br /> liberty in that country. Germany is not an
      infidel<br /> nation, or speech would be free, and every man<br /> would be
      allowed to express his honest thoughts.<br /> <br /> Wherever I see Liberty
      in chains, wherever the<br /> expression of opinion is a crime, I know that
      that<br /> country is not infidel; I know that the people are not<br />
      ruled by reason. I also know that the greatest men<br /> of Germany&mdash;her
      Freethinkers, her scientists, her<br /> writers, her philosophers, are, for
      the most part, in-<br /> fidel. Yet Germany is called a Christian nation,
      and<br /> ought to be so called until her citizens are free.<br /> <br /> 331<br />
      <br /> France is also claimed as a Christian country. This<br /> is not
      entirely true. France once was thoroughly<br /> Catholic, completely
      Christian. At the time of the<br /> massacre of Saint Bartholomew, the
      French were<br /> Christians. Christian France made exiles of the<br />
      Huguenots. Christian France for years and years<br /> was the property of
      the Jesuits. Christian France<br /> was ignorant, cruel, orthodox and
      infamous. When<br /> France was Christian, witnesses were cross-examined<br />
      with instruments of torture.<br /> <br /> Now France is not entirely under
      Catholic control,<br /> and yet she is by far the most prosperous nation in<br />
      Europe. I saw, only the other day, a letter from a<br /> Protestant bishop,
      in which he states that there are<br /> only about a million Protestants in
      France, and only<br /> four or five millions of Catholics, and admits, in a<br />
      very melancholy way, that thirty-four or thirty-five<br /> millions are
      Freethinkers. The bishop is probably<br /> mistaken in his figures, but
      France is the best housed,<br /> the best fed, the best clad country in
      Europe.<br /> <br /> Only a little while ago, France was overrun, trampled<br />
      into the very earth, by the victorious hosts of Ger-<br /> many, and France
      purchased her peace with the<br /> savings of centuries. And yet France is
      now rich and<br /> prosperous and free, and Germany poor, discontented<br />
      <br /> 332<br /> <br /> and enslaved. Hundreds and thousands of Germans,<br />
      unable to find liberty at home, are coming to the<br /> United States.<br />
      <br /> I admit that England is a Christian country. Any<br /> doubts upon
      this point can be dispelled by reading<br /> her history&mdash;her career
      in India, what she has done<br /> in China, her treatment of Ireland, of
      the American<br /> Colonies, her attitude during our Civil war; all these<br />
      things show conclusively that England is a Christian<br /> nation.<br />
      <br /> Religion has filled Great Britain with war. The<br /> history of the
      Catholics, of the Episcopalians, of<br /> Cromwell&mdash;all the burnings,
      the maimings, the brand-<br /> ings, the imprisonments, the confiscations,
      the civil<br /> wars, the bigotry, the crime&mdash;show conclusively that<br />
      Great Britain has enjoyed to the full the blessings of<br /> "our most holy
      religion."<br /> <br /> Of course, Mr. Talmage claims the United States<br />
      as a Christian country. The truth is, our country is<br /> not as Christian
      as it once was. When heretics were<br /> hanged in New England, when the
      laws of Virginia<br /> and Maryland provided that the tongue of any man<br />
      who denied the doctrine of the Trinity should be<br /> bored with hot
      iron,, and that for the second offence<br /> he should suffer death, I
      admit that this country was<br /> <br /> 333<br /> <br /> Christian. When we
      engaged in the slave trade,<br /> when our flag protected piracy and murder
      in every<br /> sea, there is not the slightest doubt that the United<br />
      States was a Christian country. When we believed<br /> in slavery, and when
      we deliberately stole the labor<br /> of four millions of people; when we
      sold women<br /> and babes, and when the people of the North<br /> enacted a
      law by virtue of which every Northern<br /> man was bound to turn hound and
      pursue a human<br /> being who was endeavoring to regain his liberty, I<br />
      admit that the United States was a Christian nation.<br /> I admit that all
      these things were upheld by the Bible<br /> &mdash;that the slave trader
      was justified by the Old Testa-<br /> ment, that the bloodhound was a kind
      of missionary<br /> in disguise, that the auction block was an altar, the<br />
      slave pen a kind of church, and that the whipping-<br /> post was
      considered almost as sacred as the cross.<br /> At that time, our country
      was a Christian nation.<br /> <br /> I heard Frederick Douglass say that he
      lectured<br /> against slavery for twenty years before the doors<br /> of a
      single church were opened to him. In New<br /> England, hundreds of
      ministers were driven from<br /> their pulpits because they preached
      against the<br /> crime of human slavery. At that time, this country<br />
      was a Christian nation.<br /> <br /> 334<br /> <br /> Only a few years ago,
      any man speaking in favor<br /> of the rights of man, endeavoring to break
      a chain<br /> from a human limb, was in danger of being mobbed<br /> by the
      Christians of this country. I admit that Dela-<br /> ware is still a
      Christian State. I heard a story about<br /> that State the other day.<br />
      <br /> About fifty years ago, an old Revolutionary soldier<br /> applied for
      a pension. He was asked his age, and he<br /> replied that he was fifty
      years old. He was told that<br /> if that was his age, he could not have
      been in the<br /> Revolutionary War, and consequently was not en-<br />
      titled to any pension. He insisted, however, that he<br /> was only fifty
      years old. Again they told him that<br /> there must be some mistake. He
      was so wrinkled,<br /> so bowed, had so many marks of age, that he must<br />
      certainly be more than fifty years old. "Well," said<br /> the old man, "if
      I must explain, I will: I lived forty<br /> "years in Delaware; but I never
      counted that time,<br /> "and I hope God won't."<br /> <br /> The fact is, we
      have grown less and less Christian<br /> every year from 1620 until now,
      and the fact is that<br /> we have grown more and more civilized, more and<br />
      more charitable, nearer and nearer just.<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage speaks as
      though all the people in<br /> what he calls the civilized world were
      Christians. Ad-<br /> <br /> 335<br /> <br /> mitting this to be true, I find
      that in these countries<br /> millions of men are educated, trained and
      drilled to<br /> kill their fellow Christians. I find Europe covered<br />
      with forts to protect Christians from Christians, and<br /> the seas filled
      with men-of-war for the purpose of<br /> ravaging the coasts and destroying
      the cities of Chris-<br /> tian nations. These countries are filled with
      prisons,<br /> with workhouses, with jails and with toiling, ignorant<br />
      and suffering millions. I find that Christians have<br /> invented most of
      the instruments of death, that<br /> Christians are the greatest soldiers,
      fighters, de-<br /> stroyers. I find that every Christian country is taxed<br />
      to its utmost to support these soldiers; that every<br /> Christian nation
      is now groaning beneath the grievous<br /> burden of monstrous debt, and
      that nearly all these<br /> debts were contracted in waging war. These
      bonds,<br /> these millions, these almost incalculable amounts,<br /> were
      given to pay for shot and shell, for rifle and<br /> torpedo, for
      men-of-war, for forts and arsenals, and<br /> all the devilish enginery of
      death. I find that each<br /> of these nations prays to God to assist it as
      against<br /> all others; and when one nation has overrun, ravaged<br /> and
      pillaged another, it immediately returns thanks<br /> to the Almighty, and
      the ravaged and pillaged kneel<br /> and thank God that it is no worse.<br />
      <br /> 336<br /> <br /> Mr. Talmage is welcome to all the evidence he can<br />
      find in the history of what he is pleased to call the<br /> civilized
      nations of the world, tending to show the<br /> inspiration of the Bible.<br />
      <br /> And right here it may be well enough to say again,<br /> that the
      question of inspiration can not be settled by<br /> the votes of the
      superstitious millions. It can not be<br /> affected by numbers. It must be
      decided by each<br /> human being for himself. If every man in this world,<br />
      with one exception, believed the Bible to be the in-<br /> spired word of
      God, the man who was the exception<br /> could not lose his right to think,
      to investigate, and to<br /> judge for himself.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      You do not think, then, that any of the<br /> arguments brought forward by
      Mr. Talmage for the<br /> purpose of establishing the inspiration of the
      Bible,<br /> are of any weight whatever?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I do
      not. I do not see how it is possible<br /> to make poorer, weaker or better
      arguments than he<br /> has made.<br /> <br /> Of course, there can be no
      "evidence" of the in-<br /> spiration of the Scriptures. What is
      "inspiration"?<br /> Did God use the prophets simply as instruments?<br />
      Did he put his thoughts in their minds, and use their<br /> <br /> 337<br />
      <br /> hands to make a record? Probably few Christians<br /> will agree as
      to what they mean by "inspiration."<br /> The general idea is, that the
      minds of the writers of<br /> the books of the Bible were controlled by the
      divine<br /> will in such a way that they expressed, independently<br /> of
      their own opinions, the thought of God. I believe it<br /> is admitted that
      God did not choose the exact words,<br /> and is not responsible for the
      punctuation or syntax.<br /> It is hard to give any reason for claiming
      more for<br /> the Bible than is claimed by those who wrote it.<br /> There
      is no claim of "inspiration" made by the writer<br /> of First and Second
      Kings. Not one word about the<br /> author having been "inspired" is found
      in the book<br /> of Job, or in Ruth, or in Chronicles, or in the Psalms,<br />
      or Ecclesiastes, or in Solomon's Song, and nothing is<br /> said about the
      author of the book of Esther having<br /> been "inspired." Christians now
      say that Matthew,<br /> Mark, Luke and John were "inspired" to write the<br />
      four gospels, and yet neither Mark, nor Luke, nor<br /> John, nor Matthew
      claims to have been "inspired."<br /> If they were "inspired," certainly
      they should have<br /> stated that fact. The very first thing stated in
      each<br /> of the gospels should have been a declaration by the<br /> writer
      that he had been "inspired," and that he was<br /> about to write the book
      under the guidance of God,<br /> <br /> 338<br /> <br /> and at the conclusion
      of each gospel there should<br /> have been a solemn statement that the
      writer had<br /> put down nothing of himself, but had in all things<br />
      followed the direction and guidance of the divine<br /> will. The church
      now endeavors to establish the<br /> inspiration of the Bible by force, by
      social ostracism,<br /> and by attacking the reputation of every man who<br />
      denies or doubts. In all Christian countries, they<br /> begin with the
      child in the cradle. Each infant is<br /> told by its mother, by its
      father, or by some of its<br /> relatives, that "the Bible is an inspired
      book." This<br /> pretended fact, by repetition "in season and out of<br />
      "season," is finally burned and branded into the<br /> brain to such a
      degree that the child of average<br /> intelligence never outgrows the
      conviction that the<br /> Bible is, in some peculiar sense, an "inspired"
      book.<br /> The question has to be settled for each generation.<br /> The
      evidence is not sufficient, and the foundation of<br /> Christianity is
      perpetually insecure. Beneath this great<br /> religious fabric there is no
      rock. For eighteen centu-<br /> ries, hundreds and thousands and millions
      of people<br /> have been endeavoring to establish the fact that the<br />
      Scriptures are inspired, and since the dawn of science,<br /> since the
      first star appeared in the night of the<br /> Middle Ages, until this
      moment, the number of<br /> <br /> 339<br /> <br /> people who have doubted
      the fact of inspiration<br /> has steadily increased. These doubts have not
      been<br /> born of ignorance, they have not been suggested by<br /> the
      unthinking. They have forced themselves upon<br /> the thoughtful, upon the
      educated, and now the ver-<br /> dict of the intellectual world is, that
      the Bible is not<br /> inspired. Notwithstanding the fact that the church<br />
      has taken advantage of infancy, has endeavored to<br /> control education,
      has filled all primers and spelling-<br /> books and readers and text books
      with superstition&mdash;<br /> feeding all minds with the miraculous and
      super-<br /> natural, the growth toward a belief in the natural<br /> and
      toward the rejection of the miraculous has been<br /> steady and sturdy
      since the sixteenth century. There<br /> has been, too, a moral growth,
      until many passages<br /> in the Bible have become barbarous, inhuman and<br />
      infamous. The Bible has remained the same, while<br /> the world has
      changed. In the light of physical and<br /> moral discovery, "the inspired
      volume" seems in<br /> many respects absurd. If the same progress is made<br />
      in the next, as in the last, century, it is very easy to<br /> predict the
      place that will then be occupied by the<br /> Bible. By comparing long
      periods of time, it is easy<br /> to measure the advance of the human race.
      Com-<br /> pare the average sermon of to-day with the average<br /> <br />
      340<br /> <br /> sermon of one hundred years ago. Compare what<br />
      ministers teach to-day with the creeds they profess<br /> to believe, and
      you will see the immense distance<br /> that even the church has traveled
      in the last century.<br /> <br /> The Christians tell us that scientific men
      have<br /> made mistakes, and that there is very little certainty<br /> in
      the domain of human knowledge. This I admit.<br /> The man who thought the
      world was flat, and who<br /> had a way of accounting for the movement of
      the<br /> heavenly bodies, had what he was pleased to call a<br />
      philosophy. He was, in his way, a geologist and an<br /> astronomer. We
      admit that he was mistaken; but<br /> if we claimed that the first
      geologist and the first<br /> astronomer were inspired, it would not do for
      us to<br /> admit that any advance had been made, or that any<br /> errors
      of theirs had been corrected. We do not<br /> claim that the first
      scientists were inspired. We do<br /> not claim that the last are inspired.
      We admit that<br /> all scientific men are fallible. We admit that they do<br />
      not know everything. We insist that they know but<br /> little, and that
      even in that little which they are sup-<br /> posed to know, there is the
      possibility of error. The<br /> first geologist said: "The earth is flat."
      Suppose<br /> that the geologists of to-day should insist that that<br />
      man was inspired, and then endeavor to show that<br /> <br /> 341<br /> <br />
      the word "flat," in the "Hebrew," did not mean<br /> quite flat, but just a
      little rounded; what would we<br /> think of their honesty? The first
      astronomer in-<br /> sisted that the sun and moon and stars revolved<br />
      around this earth&mdash;that this little earth was the centre<br /> of the
      entire system. Suppose that the astronomers<br /> of to-day should insist
      that that astronomer was in-<br /> spired, and should try to explain, and
      say that he<br /> simply used the language of the common people, and<br />
      when he stated that the sun and moon and stars re-<br /> volved around the
      earth, he merely meant that they<br /> "apparently revolved," and that the
      earth, in fact,<br /> turned over, would we consider them honest men?<br />
      You might as well say that the first painter was in-<br /> spired, or that
      the first sculptor had the assistance of<br /> God, as to say that the
      first writer, or the first book-<br /> maker, was divinely inspired. It is
      more probable<br /> that the modern geologist is inspired than that the an-<br />
      cient one was, because the modern geologist is nearer<br /> right. It is
      more probable that William Lloyd Gar-<br /> rison was inspired upon the
      question of slavery than<br /> that Moses was. It is more probable that the
      author<br /> of the Declaration of Independence spoke by divine<br />
      authority than that the author of the Pentateuch did.<br /> In other words,
      if there can be any evidence of<br /> <br /> 342<br /> <br /> "inspiration,"
      it must lie in the fact of doing or<br /> saying the best possible thing
      that could have been<br /> done or said at that time or upon that subject.<br />
      <br /> To make myself clear: The only possible evidence<br /> of
      "inspiration" would be perfection&mdash;a perfection ex-<br /> celling
      anything that man unaided had ever attained.<br /> An "inspired" book
      should excel all other books; an<br /> inspired statue should be the best
      in this world; an in-<br /> spired painting should be beyond all others. If
      the Bible<br /> has been improved in any particular, it was not, in that<br />
      particular, ''inspired." If slavery is wrong, the Bible is<br /> not
      inspired. If polygamy is vile and loathsome, the<br /> Bible is not
      inspired. If wars of extermination are cruel<br /> and heartless, the Bible
      is not "inspired." If there is<br /> within that book a contradiction of
      any natural fact; if<br /> there is one ignorant falsehood, if there is one
      mistake,<br /> then it is not "inspired." I do not mean mistakes that<br />
      have grown out of translations; but if there was in<br /> the original
      manuscript one mistake, then it is not<br /> "inspired." I do not demand a
      miracle; I do not<br /> demand a knowledge of the future; I simply demand<br />
      an absolute knowledge of the past. I demand an ab-<br /> solute knowledge
      of the then present; I demand a<br /> knowledge of the constitution of the
      human mind&mdash;<br /> of the facts in nature, and that is all I demand.<br />
      <br /> 343<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If I understand you, you think that
      all<br /> political power should come from the people; do you<br /> not
      believe in any "special providence," and do you<br /> take the ground that
      God does not interest himself<br /> in the affairs of nations and
      individuals?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The Christian idea is that God made
      the<br /> world, and made certain laws for the government of<br /> matter
      and mind, and that he never interferes except<br /> upon special occasions,
      when the ordinary laws fail to<br /> work out the desired end. Their notion
      is, that the<br /> Lord now and then stops the horses simply to show<br />
      that he is driving. It seems to me that if an infinitely<br /> wise being
      made the world, he must have made it<br /> the best possible; and that if
      he made laws for the<br /> government of matter and mind, he must have made<br />
      the best possible laws. If this is true, not one of<br /> these laws can be
      violated without producing a posi-<br /> tive injury. It does not seem
      probable that infinite<br /> wisdom would violate a law that infinite
      wisdom had<br /> made.<br /> <br /> Most ministers insist that God now and
      then in-<br /> terferes in the affairs of this world; that he has not<br />
      interfered as much lately as he did formerly. When<br /> the world was
      comparatively new, it required alto-<br /> gether more tinkering and fixing
      than at present.<br /> <br /> 344<br /> <br /> Things are at last in a
      reasonably good condition,<br /> and consequently a great amount of
      interference is<br /> not necessary. In old times it was found necessary
      fre-<br /> quently to raise the dead, to change the nature of fire<br /> and
      water, to punish people with plagues and famine,<br /> to destroy cities by
      storms of fire and brimstone, to<br /> change women into salt, to cast
      hailstones upon<br /> heathen, to interfere with the movements of our<br />
      planetary system, to stop the earth not only, but<br /> sometimes to make
      it turn the other way, to arrest<br /> the moon, and to make water stand up
      like a wall.<br /> Now and then, rivers were divided by striking them<br />
      with a coat, and people were taken to heaven in<br /> chariots of fire.
      These miracles, in addition to curing<br /> the sick, the halt, the deaf
      and blind, were in former<br /> times found necessary, but since the
      "apostolic age,"<br /> nothing of the kind has been resorted to except in<br />
      Catholic countries. Since the death of the last<br /> apostle, God has
      appeared only to members of the<br /> Catholic Church, and all modern
      miracles have been<br /> performed for the benefit of Catholicism. There is<br />
      no authentic account of the Virgin Mary having ever<br /> appeared to a
      Protestant. The bones of Protestant<br /> saints have never cured a
      solitary disease. Protest-<br /> ants now say that the testimony of the
      Catholics can<br /> <br /> 345<br /> <br /> not be relied upon, and yet, the
      authenticity of every<br /> book in the New Testament was established by
      Cath-<br /> olic testimony. Some few miracles were performed<br /> in
      Scotland, and in fact in England and the United<br /> States, but they were
      so small that they are hardly<br /> worth mentioning. Now and then, a man
      was struck<br /> dead for taking the name of the Lord in vain. Now<br /> and
      then, people were drowned who were found in<br /> boats on Sunday. Whenever
      anybody was about to<br /> commit murder, God has not interfered&mdash;the
      reason<br /> being that he gave man free-will, and expects to hold<br /> him
      accountable in another world, and there is no<br /> exception to this
      free-will doctrine, but in cases<br /> where men swear or violate the
      Sabbath. They are<br /> allowed to commit all other crimes without any in-<br />
      terference on the part of the Lord.<br /> <br /> My own opinion is, that the
      clergy found it neces-<br /> sary to preserve the Sabbath for their own
      uses, and<br /> for that reason endeavored to impress the people<br /> with
      the enormity of its violation, and for that purpose<br /> gave instances of
      people being drowned and suddenly<br /> struck dead for working or amusing
      themselves on that<br /> day. The clergy have objected to any other places
      of<br /> amusement except their own, being opened on that<br /> day. They
      wished to compel people either to go to<br /> <br /> 346<br /> <br /> church
      or stay at home. They have also known<br /> that profanity tended to do
      away with the feelings<br /> of awe they wished to cultivate, and for that
      reason<br /> they have insisted that swearing was one of the most<br />
      terrible of crimes, exciting above all others the wrath<br /> of God.<br />
      <br /> There was a time when people fell dead for having<br /> spoken
      disrespectfully to a priest. The priest at that<br /> time pretended to be
      the visible representative of<br /> God, and as such, entitled to a degree
      of reverence<br /> amounting almost to worship. Several cases are<br />
      given in the ecclesiastical history of Scotland where<br /> men were
      deprived of speech for having spoken<br /> rudely to a parson.<br /> <br />
      These stories were calculated to increase the im-<br /> portance of the
      clergy and to convince people that<br /> they were under the special care
      of the Deity. The<br /> story about the bears devouring the little children<br />
      was told in the first place, and has been repeated<br /> since, simply to
      protect ministers from the laughter<br /> of children. There ought to be
      carved on each side<br /> of every pulpit a bear with fragments of children
      in<br /> its mouth, as this animal has done so much to protect<br /> the
      dignity of the clergy.<br /> <br /> Besides the protection of ministers, the
      drowning<br /> <br /> 347<br /> <br /> of breakers of the Sabbath, and
      striking a few people<br /> dead for using profane language, I think there
      is no<br /> evidence of any providential interference in the affairs<br />
      of this world in what may be called modern times.<br /> Ministers have
      endeavored to show that great calam-<br /> ities have been brought upon
      nations and cities as a<br /> punishment for the wickedness of the people.
      They<br /> have insisted that some countries have been visited<br /> with
      earthquakes because the people had failed to<br /> discharge their
      religious duties; but as earthquakes<br /> happened in uninhabited
      countries, and often at sea,<br /> where no one is hurt, most people have
      concluded<br /> that they are not sent as punishments. They have<br />
      insisted that cities have been burned as a punish-<br /> ment, and to show
      the indignation of the Lord, but<br /> at the same time they have admitted
      that if the<br /> streets had been wider, the fire departments better<br />
      organized, and wooden buildings fewer, the design<br /> of the Lord would
      have been frustrated.<br /> <br /> After reading the history of the world,
      it is some-<br /> what difficult to find which side the Lord is really on.<br />
      He has allowed Catholics to overwhelm and de-<br /> stroy Protestants, and
      then he has allowed Protestants<br /> to overwhelm and destroy Catholics.
      He has allowed<br /> Christianity to triumph over Paganism, and he allowed<br />
      <br /> 348<br /> <br /> Mohammedans to drive back the hosts of the cross<br />
      from the sepulchre of his son. It is curious that this<br /> God would
      allow the slave trade to go on, and yet<br /> punish the violators of the
      Sabbath. It is simply<br /> wonderful that he would allow kings to wage
      cruel<br /> and remorseless war, to sacrifice millions upon the<br /> altar
      of heartless ambition, and at the same time<br /> strike a man dead for
      taking his name in vain. It is<br /> wonderful that he allowed slavery to
      exist for centu-<br /> ries in the United States; that he allows polygamy<br />
      now in Utah; that he cares nothing for liberty in<br /> Russia, nothing for
      free speech in Germany, nothing<br /> for the sorrows of the overworked,
      underpaid millions<br /> of the world; that he cares nothing for the
      innocent<br /> languishing in prisons, nothing for the patriots con-<br />
      demned to death, nothing for the heart-broken<br /> widows and orphans,
      nothing for the starving, and<br /> yet has ample time to note a sparrow's
      fall. If he<br /> would only strike dead the would-be murderers; if<br /> he
      would only palsy the hands of husbands' uplifted<br /> to strike their
      wives; if he would render speechless<br /> the cursers of children, he
      could afford to overlook<br /> the swearers and breakers of his Sabbath.<br />
      <br /> For one, I am not satisfied with the government<br /> of this world,
      and I am going to do what little I can<br /> <br /> 349<br /> <br /> to make
      it better. I want more thought and less<br /> fear, more manhood and less
      superstition, less prayer<br /> and more help, more education, more reason,
      more<br /> intellectual hospitality, and above all, and over all,<br /> more
      liberty and kindness.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you think that God,
      if there be one,<br /> when he saves or damns a man, will take into con-<br />
      sideration all the circumstances of the man's life?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Suppose that two orphan boys, James<br /> and John, are given homes. James
      is taken into a<br /> Christian family and John into an infidel. James<br />
      becomes a Christian, and dies in the faith. John be-<br /> comes an
      infidel, and dies without faith in Christ.<br /> According to the Christian
      religion, as commonly<br /> preached, James will go to heaven, and John to
      hell.<br /> <br /> Now, suppose that God knew that if James had<br /> been
      raised by the infidel family, he would have died<br /> an infidel, and that
      if John had been raised by the<br /> Christian family, he would have died a
      Christian.<br /> What then? Recollect that the boys did not choose<br /> the
      families in which they were placed.<br /> <br /> Suppose that a child, cast
      away upon an island in<br /> which he found plenty of food, grew to
      manhood;<br /> and suppose that after he had reached mature years,<br />
      <br /> 350<br /> <br /> the island was visited by a missionary who taught a<br />
      false religion; and suppose that this islander was con-<br /> vinced that
      he ought to worship a wooden idol; and<br /> suppose, further, that the
      worship consisted in sacri-<br /> ficing animals; and suppose the islander,
      actuated<br /> only by what he conceived to be his duty and by<br />
      thankfulness, sacrificed a toad every night and every<br /> morning upon
      the altar of his wooden god; that<br /> when the sky looked black and
      threatening he sacri-<br /> ficed two toads; that when feeling unwell he
      sacrificed<br /> three; and suppose that in all this he was honest, that<br />
      he really believed that the shedding of toad-blood<br /> would soften the
      heart of his god toward him? And<br /> suppose that after he had become
      fully-convinced<br /> of the truth of his religion, a missionary of the<br />
      "true religion" should visit the island, and tell the<br /> history of the
      Jews&mdash;unfold the whole scheme of<br /> salvation? And suppose that the
      islander should<br /> honestly reject the true religion? Suppose he should<br />
      say that he had "internal evidence" not only, but<br /> that many miracles
      had been performed by his god,<br /> in his behalf; that often when the sky
      was black<br /> with storm, he had sacrificed a toad, and in a few<br />
      moments the sun was again visible, the heavens blue,<br /> and without a
      cloud; that on several occasions, having<br /> <br /> 351<br /> <br />
      forgotten at evening to sacrifice his toad, he found<br /> himself unable
      to sleep&mdash;that his conscience smote<br /> him, he had risen, made the
      sacrifice, returned to his<br /> bed, and in a few moments sunk into a
      serene and<br /> happy slumber? And suppose, further, that the man<br />
      honestly believed that the efficacy of the sacrifice<br /> depended largely
      on the size of the toad? Now<br /> suppose that in this belief the man had
      died,&mdash;what<br /> then?<br /> <br /> It must be remembered that God knew
      when the<br /> missionary of the false religion went to the island;<br />
      and knew that the islander would be convinced of the<br /> truth of the
      false religion; and he also knew that the<br /> missionary of the true
      religion could not, by any<br /> possibility, convince the islander of the
      error of his<br /> way; what then?<br /> <br /> If God is infinite, we cannot
      speak of him as<br /> making efforts, as being tired. We cannot con-<br />
      sistently say that one thing is easy to him, and<br /> another thing is
      hard, providing both are possible.<br /> This being so, why did not God
      reveal himself to<br /> every human being? Instead of having an inspired<br />
      book, why did he not make inspired folks? Instead<br /> of having his
      commandments put on tables of stone,<br /> why did he not write them on
      each human brain?<br /> <br /> 352<br /> <br /> Why was not the mind of each
      man so made that<br /> every religious truth necessary to his salvation was<br />
      an axiom?<br /> <br /> Do we not know absolutely that man is greatly<br />
      influenced by his surroundings? If Mr. Talmage<br /> had been born in
      Turkey, is it not probable that<br /> he would now be a whirling Dervish?
      If he had<br /> first seen the light in Central Africa, he might now<br />
      have been prostrate before some enormous serpent;<br /> if in India, he
      might have been a Brahmin, running a<br /> prayer-machine; if in Spain, he
      would probably have<br /> been a priest, with his beads and holy water. Had<br />
      he been born among the North American Indians,<br /> he would speak of the
      "Great Spirit," and solemnly<br /> smoke the the pipe of peace.<br /> <br />
      Mr. Talmage teaches that it is the duty of children<br /> to perpetuate the
      errors of their parents; conse-<br /> quently, the religion of his parents
      determined his<br /> theology. It is with him not a question of reason,<br />
      but of parents; not a question of argument, but of<br /> filial affection.
      He does not wish to be a philoso-<br /> pher, but an obedient son. Suppose
      his father had<br /> been a Catholic, and his mother a Protestant,&mdash;what<br />
      then? Would he show contempt for his mother by<br /> following the path of
      his father; or would he show<br /> <br /> 353<br /> <br /> disrespect for his
      father, by accepting the religion of<br /> his mother; or would he have
      become a Protestant<br /> with Catholic proclivities, or a Catholic with
      Protest-<br /> ant leanings? Suppose his parents had both been<br />
      infidels&mdash;what then?<br /> <br /> Is it not better for each one to
      decide honestly for<br /> himself? Admitting that your parents were good
      and<br /> kind; admitting that they were honest in their views,<br /> why
      not have the courage to say, that in your opinion,<br /> father and mother
      were both mistaken? No one can<br /> honor his parents by being a
      hypocrite, or an intellectu-<br /> al coward. Whoever is absolutely true to
      himself, is<br /> true to his parents, and true to the whole world. Who-<br />
      ever is untrue to himself, is false to all mankind. Re-<br /> ligion must
      be an individual matter. If there is a God,<br /> and if there is a day of
      judgment, the church that a man<br /> belongs to will not be tried, but the
      man will be tried.<br /> <br /> It is a fact that the religion of most
      people was made<br /> for them by others; that they have accepted certain<br />
      dogmas, not because they have examined them, but<br /> because they were
      told that they were true. Most of<br /> the people in the United States,
      had they been born in<br /> Turkey, would now be Mohammedans, and most of<br />
      the Turks, had they been born in Spain, would now<br /> be Catholics.<br />
      <br /> 354<br /> <br /> It is almost, if not quite, impossible for a man to<br />
      rise entirely above the ideas, views, doctrines and re-<br /> ligions of
      his tribe or country. No one expects to<br /> find philosophers in Central
      Africa, or scientists<br /> among the Fejees. No one expects to find
      philoso-<br /> phers or scientists in any country where the church<br /> has
      absolute control.<br /> <br /> If there is an infinitely good and wise God,
      of<br /> course he will take into consideration the surround-<br /> ings of
      every human being. He understands the<br /> philosophy of environment, and
      of heredity. He<br /> knows exactly the influence of the mother, of all<br />
      associates, of all associations. He will also take into<br /> consideration
      the amount, quality and form of each<br /> brain, and whether the brain was
      healthy or diseased.<br /> He will take into consideration the strength of
      the<br /> passions, the weakness of the judgment. He will<br /> know exactly
      the force of all temptation&mdash;what was<br /> resisted. He will take an
      account of every effort<br /> made in the right direction, and will
      understand<br /> all the winds and waves and quicksands and shores<br /> and
      shallows in, upon and around the sea of every<br /> life.<br /> <br /> My own
      opinion is, that if such a being exists, and<br /> all these things are
      taken into consideration, we will<br /> <br /> 355<br /> <br /> be absolutely
      amazed to see how small the difference<br /> is between the "good" and the
      "bad." Certainly<br /> there is no such difference as would justify a being<br />
      of infinite wisdom and benevolence in rewarding one<br /> with eternal joy
      and punishing the other with eternal<br /> pain.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      What are the principal reasons that<br /> have satisfied you that the Bible
      is not an inspired<br /> book?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The great evils
      that have afflicted this<br /> world are:<br /> <br /> <i>First</i>. Human
      slavery&mdash;where men have bought<br /> and sold their fellow-men&mdash;sold
      babes from mothers,<br /> and have practiced) every conceivable cruelty
      upon<br /> the helpless.<br /> <br /> <i>Second</i>. Polygamy&mdash;an
      institution that destroys<br /> the home, that treats woman as a simple
      chattel, that<br /> does away with the sanctity of marriage, and with all<br />
      that is sacred in love.<br /> <br /> <i>Third</i>. Wars of conquest and
      extermination&mdash;<br /> by which nations have been made the food of the<br />
      sword.<br /> <br /> <i>Fourth</i>. The idea entertained by each nation that<br />
      all other nations are destitute of rights&mdash;in other<br /> <br /> 356<br />
      <br /> words, patriotism founded upon egotism, prejudice,<br /> and love of
      plunder.<br /> <br /> <i>Fifth</i>. Religious persecution.<br /> <br /> <i>Sixth</i>.
      The divine right of kings&mdash;an idea that<br /> rests upon the
      inequality of human rights, and insists<br /> that people should be
      governed without their con-<br /> sent; that the right of one man to govern
      another<br /> comes from God, and not from the consent of the<br />
      governed. This is caste&mdash;one of the most odious<br /> forms of
      slavery.<br /> <br /> <i>Seventh</i>. A belief in malicious supernatural be-<br />
      ings&mdash;devils, witches, and wizards.<br /> <br /> <i>Eighth</i>. A
      belief in an infinite being who or-<br /> dered, commanded, established and
      approved all<br /> these evils.<br /> <br /> <i>Ninth</i>. The idea that one
      man can be good for<br /> another, or bad for another&mdash;that is to say,
      that one<br /> can be rewarded for the goodness of another, or<br /> justly
      punished for the sins of another.<br /> <br /> <i>Tenth</i>. The dogma that
      a finite being can commit<br /> an infinite sin, and thereby incur the
      eternal dis-<br /> pleasure of an infinitely good being, and be justly<br />
      subjected to eternal torment.<br /> <br /> My principal objection to the
      Bible is that it sus-<br /> tains all of these ten evils&mdash;that it is
      the advocate of<br /> <br /> 357<br /> <br /> human slavery, the friend of
      polygamy; that within<br /> its pages I find the command to wage wars of
      ex-<br /> termination; that I find also that the Jews were<br /> taught to
      hate foreigners&mdash;to consider all human<br /> beings as inferior to
      themselves; I also find persecu-<br /> tion commanded as a religious duty;
      that kings were<br /> seated upon their thrones by the direct act of God,<br />
      and that to rebel against a king was rebellion against<br /> God. I object
      to the Bible also because I find within<br /> its pages the infamous spirit
      of caste&mdash;I see the sons<br /> of Levi set apart as the perpetual
      beggars and<br /> governors of a people; because I find the air filled<br />
      with demons seeking to injure and betray the sons<br /> of men; because
      this book is the fountain of modern<br /> superstition, the bulwark of
      tyranny and the fortress<br /> of caste. This book also subverts the idea
      of justice<br /> by threatening infinite punishment for the sins of a<br />
      finite being.<br /> <br /> At the same time, I admit&mdash;as I always have
      ad-<br /> mitted&mdash;that there are good passages in the Bible&mdash;<br />
      good laws, good teachings, with now and then a true<br /> line of history.
      But when it is asserted that every<br /> word was written by inspiration&mdash;that
      a being of in-<br /> finite wisdom and goodness is its author,&mdash;then<br />
      I raise the standard of revolt.<br /> <br /> 358<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      What do you think of the declaration<br /> of Mr. Talmage that the Bible
      will be read in heaven<br /> throughout all the endless ages of eternity?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course I know but very little as to<br /> what is
      or will be done in heaven. My knowledge<br /> of that country is somewhat
      limited, and it may be<br /> possible that the angels will spend most of
      their time<br /> in turning over the sacred leaves of the Old Testa-<br />
      ment. I can not positively deny the statement of the<br /> Reverend Mr.
      Talmage as I have but very little idea<br /> as to how the angels manage to
      kill time.<br /> <br /> The Reverend Mr. Spurgeon stated in a sermon<br />
      that some people wondered what they would do<br /> through all eternity in
      heaven. He said that, as for<br /> himself, for the first hundred thousand
      years he<br /> would look at the wound in one of the Savior's<br /> feet,
      and for the next hundred thousand years he<br /> would look at the wound in
      his other foot, and<br /> for the next hundred thousand years he would<br />
      look at the wound in one of his hands, and for<br /> the next hundred
      thousand years he would look at<br /> the wound in the other hand, and for
      the next<br /> hundred thousand years he would look at the wound<br /> in
      his side.<br /> <br /> Surely, nothing could be more delightful than this<br />
      <br /> 359<br /> <br /> A man capable of being happy in such employment,<br />
      could of course take great delight in reading even<br /> the genealogies of
      the Old Testament. It is very<br /> easy to see what a glow of joy would
      naturally over-<br /> spread the face of an angel while reading the history<br />
      of the Jewish wars, how the seraphim and cherubim<br /> would clasp their
      rosy palms in ecstasy over the fate<br /> of Korah and his company, and
      what laughter would<br /> wake the echoes of the New Jerusalem as some one<br />
      told again the story of the children and the bears;<br /> and what happy
      groups, with folded pinions, would<br /> smilingly listen to the 109th
      Psalm.<br /> <br /> [Illustration: 371]<br /> <br /> An orthodox "state of

      <br /> <big><b>THE TALMAGIAN CATECHISM.</b></big><br /> <br /> <i>As Mr.
      Talmage delivered the series of sermons<br /> referred to in these
      interviews, for the purpose<br /> of furnishing arguments to the young, so
      that they<br /> might not be misled by the sophistry of modern<br />
      infi-delity, I have thought it best to set forth,<br /> for use in Sunday
      schools, the pith and marrow of<br /> what he has been pleased to say, in
      the form of</i><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <big><b>A SHORTER CATECHISM.</b></big><br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Who made you?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Jehovah,
      the original Presbyterian.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What else did he
      make?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He made the world and all things.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did he make the world out of nothing?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      No.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What did he make it out of?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Out of his "omnipotence." Many infidels<br /> have pretended that if God
      made the universe, and if<br /> there was nothing until he did make it, he
      had nothing<br /> to make it out of. Of course this is perfectly absurd<br />
      when we remember that he always had his "omnipo-<br /> tence and that is,
      undoubtedly, the material used.<br /> <br /> 364<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Did he create his own "omnipotence"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly
      not, he was always omnipo-<br /> tent.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Then if
      he always had "omnipotence,"<br /> he did not "create" the material of
      which the uni-<br /> verse is made; he simply took a portion of his<br />
      "omnipotence" and changed it to "universe"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Certainly, that is the way I under-<br /> stand it.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Is he still omnipotent, and has he as<br /> much "omnipotence" now as he
      ever had?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Well, I suppose he has.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      How long did it take God to make the<br /> universe?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Six "good-whiles."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How long is a "good-while"?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. That will depend upon the future dis-<br /> coveries
      of geologists. "Good-whiles" are of such<br /> a nature that they can be
      pulled out, or pushed up;<br /> and it is utterly impossible for any
      infidel, or scien-<br /> tific geologist, to make any period that a
      "good-while"<br /> won't fit.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What do you
      understand by "the<br /> "morning and evening" of a "good-while"?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course the words "morning and<br /> <br /> 365<br />
      <br /> "evening" are used figuratively, and mean simply<br /> the beginning
      and the ending, of each "good-while."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. On what
      day did God make vegetation?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. On the third day.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Was that before the sun was made?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Yes; a "good-while" before.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How did vegetation
      grow without sun-<br /> light?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. My own opinion is,
      that it was either<br /> "nourished by the glare of volcanoes in the moon<br />
      or "it may have gotten sufficient light from rivers<br /> "of molten
      granite;" or, "sufficient light might have<br /> "been emitted by the
      crystallization of rocks." It<br /> has been suggested that light might
      have been fur-<br /> nished by fire-flies and phosphorescent bugs and<br />
      worms, but this I regard as going too far.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do
      you think that light emitted by<br /> rocks would be sufficient to produce
      trees?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes, with the assistance of the "Aurora<br />
      "Borealis, or even the Aurora Australis;" but with<br /> both, most
      assuredly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If the light of which you speak was<br />
      sufficient, why was the sun made?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. To keep time
      with.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What did God make man of?<br /> <br /> 366<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He made man of dust and "omnipo-<br /> "tence."<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did he make a woman at the same<br /> time that he
      made a man?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No; he thought at one time to avoid<br />
      the necessity of making a woman, and he caused all<br /> the animals to
      pass before Adam, to see what he<br /> would call them, and to see whether
      a fit companion<br /> could be found for him. Among them all, not one<br />
      suited Adam, and Jehovah immediately saw that he<br /> would have to make
      an help-meet on purpose.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What was woman made
      of?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. She was made out of "man's side, out of<br />
      his right side," and some more "omnipotence." Infi-<br /> dels say that she
      was made out of a rib, or a bone, but<br /> that is because they do not
      understand Hebrew.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What was the object of
      making woman<br /> out of man's side?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. So that a
      young man would think more<br /> of a neighbor's girl than of his own uncle
      or grand-<br /> father.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What did God do with
      Adam and Eve<br /> after he got them done?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He put
      them into a garden to see what<br /> they would do.<br /> <br /> 367<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do we know where the Garden of Eden<br /> was, and
      have we ever found any place where a<br /> "river parted and became into
      four heads"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. We are not certain where this
      garden<br /> was, and the river that parted into four heads cannot<br /> at
      present be found. Infidels have had a great deal<br /> to say about these
      four rivers, but they will wish<br /> they had even one, one of these days.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. What happened to Adam and Eve in<br /> the garden?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. They were tempted by a snake who was<br /> an
      exceedingly good talker, and who probably came<br /> in walking on the end
      of his tail. This supposition<br /> is based upon the fact that, as a
      punishment, he was<br /> condemned to crawl on his belly. Before that time,<br />
      of course, he walked upright.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What happened
      then?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Our first parents gave way, ate of the<br />
      forbidden fruit, and in consequence, disease and<br /> death entered the
      world. Had it not been for this,<br /> there would have been no death and
      no disease.<br /> Suicide would have been impossible, and a man<br /> could
      have been blown into a thousand atoms by<br /> dynamite, and the pieces
      would immediately have<br /> come together again. Fire would have refused
      to<br /> <br /> 368<br /> <br /> burn and water to drown; there could have
      been no<br /> hunger, no thirst; all things would have been equally<br />
      healthy.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you mean to say that there would<br />
      have been no death in the world, either of animals,<br /> insects, or
      persons?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do you also think that all briers and<br /> thorns sprang from the same
      source, and that had<br /> the apple not been eaten, no bush in the world<br />
      would have had a thorn, and brambles and thistles<br /> would have been
      unknown?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Would there have been no poisonous<br /> plants, no poisonous reptiles?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No, sir; there would have been none;<br /> there would
      have been no evil in the world if Adam<br /> and Eve had not partaken of
      the forbidden fruit.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Was the snake who tempted
      them to<br /> eat, evil?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly. '<br /> <br />
      <i>Question</i>. Was he in the world before the for-<br /> bidden fruit was
      eaten?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course he was; he tempted them to<br />
      eat it<br /> <br /> 369<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How, then, do you
      account for the fact<br /> that, before the forbidden fruit was eaten, an
      evil<br /> serpent was in the world?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Perhaps
      apples had been eaten in other<br /> worlds.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is
      it not wonderful that such awful con-<br /> sequences flowed from so small
      an act?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. It is not for you to reason about it;
      you<br /> should simply remember that God is omnipotent.<br /> There is but
      one way to answer these things, and<br /> that is to admit their truth.
      Nothing so puts the<br /> Infinite out of temper as to see a human being<br />
      impudent enough to rely upon his reason. The<br /> moment we rely upon our
      reason, we abandon God,<br /> and try to take care of ourselves. Whoever
      relies<br /> entirely upon God, has no need of reason, and<br /> reason has
      no need of him.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Were our first parents under
      the im-<br /> mediate protection of an infinite God?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      They were.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why did he not protect them? Why<br />
      did he not warn them of this snake? Why did he<br /> not put them on their
      guard? Why did he not<br /> make them so sharp, intellectually, that they
      could<br /> not be deceived? Why did he not destroy that<br /> <br /> 370<br />
      <br /> snake; or how did he come to make him; what did<br /> he make him
      for?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. You must remember that, although God<br />
      made Adam and Eve perfectly good, still he was very<br /> anxious to test
      them. He also gave them the power<br /> of choice, knowing at the same time
      exactly what they<br /> would choose, and knowing that he had made them<br />
      so that they must choose in a certain way. A being<br /> of infinite wisdom
      tries experiments. Knowing ex-<br /> actly what will happen, he wishes to
      see if it will.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What punishment did God
      inflict upon<br /> Adam and Eve for the sin of having eaten the for-<br />
      bidden fruit?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He pronounced a curse upon the
      woman,<br /> saying that in sorrow she should bring forth children,<br />
      and that her husband should rule over her; that she,<br /> having tempted
      her husband, was made his slave;<br /> and through her, all married women
      have been de-<br /> prived of their natural liberty. On account of the<br />
      sin of Adam and Eve, God cursed the ground, saying<br /> that it should
      bring forth thorns and thistles, and<br /> that man should eat his bread in
      sorrow, and that he<br /> should eat the herb of the field.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Did he turn them out of the garden<br /> because of their sin?<br /> <br />
      371<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No. The reason God gave for turning<br />
      them out of the garden was: "Behold the man is<br /> "become as one of us,
      to know good and evil; and<br /> "now, lest he put forth his hand and take
      of the<br /> "tree of life and eat and live forever, therefore, the<br />
      "Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden<br /> "to till the ground
      from whence he was taken."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If the man had
      eaten of the tree of life,<br /> would he have lived forever?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Certainly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Was he turned out to prevent his<br />
      eating?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He was.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Then
      the Old Testament tells us how we<br /> lost immortality, not that we are
      immortal, does it?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes; it tells us how we lost
      it.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Was God afraid that Adam and Eve<br />
      might get back into the garden, and eat of the fruit<br /> of the tree of
      life?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I suppose he was, as he placed "cher-<br />
      "ubim and a flaming sword which turned every<br /> "way to guard the tree
      of life."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Has any one ever seen any of these<br />
      cherubim?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Not that I know of.<br /> <br /> 372<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Where is the flaming sword now?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Some angel has it in heaven.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you understand
      that God made<br /> coats of skins, and clothed Adam and Eve when<br /> he
      turned them out of the garden?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes, sir.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you really believe that the infinite<br /> God
      killed some animals, took their skins from them,<br /> cut out and sewed up
      clothes for Adam and Eve?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The Bible says so; we
      know that he<br /> had patterns for clothes, because he showed some<br /> to
      Moses on Mount Sinai.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. About how long did God
      continue<br /> to pay particular attention to his children in this<br />
      world?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. For about fifteen hundred years; and<br />
      some of the people lived to be nearly a thousand<br /> years of age.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did this God establish any schools or<br />
      institutions of learning? Did he establish any church?<br /> Did he ordain
      any ministers, or did he have any re-<br /> vivals?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      No; he allowed the world to go on<br /> pretty much in its own way. He did
      not even keep<br /> his own boys at home. They came down and made<br />
      <br /> 373<br /> <br /> love to the daughters of men, and finally the world<br />
      got exceedingly bad.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What did God do then?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He made up his mind that he would drown<br /> them.
      You see they were all totally depraved,&mdash;in<br /> every joint and
      sinew of their bodies, in every drop<br /> of their blood, and in every
      thought of their brains.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did he drown them
      all?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No, he saved eight, to start with again.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Were these eight persons totally de-<br /> praved?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why did he not kill
      them, and start<br /> over again with a perfect pair? Would it not have<br />
      been better to have had his flood at first, before he<br /> made anybody,
      and drowned the snake?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. "God's way are not our
      ways;" and<br /> besides, you must remember that "a thousand years<br />
      "are as one day" with God.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How did God destroy
      the people?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. By water; it rained forty days and
      forty<br /> nights, and "the fountains of the great deep were<br /> "broken
      up."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How deep was the water?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      About five miles.<br /> <br /> 374<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How much did
      it rain each day?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. About eight hundred feet;
      though the<br /> better opinion now is, that it was a local flood. In-<br />
      fidels have raised objections and pressed them to that<br /> degree that
      most orthodox people admit that the<br /> flood was rather local.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. If it was a local flood, why did they put<br />
      birds of the air into the ark? Certainly, birds could<br /> have avoided a
      local flood?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. If you take this away from us, what
      do<br /> you propose to give us in its place? Some of the<br /> best people
      of the world have believed this story.<br /> Kind husbands, loving mothers,
      and earnest patriots<br /> have believed it, and that is sufficient.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. At the time God made these people,<br /> did he know
      that he would have to drown them all?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course
      he did.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did he know when he made them that<br />
      they would all be failures?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why, then, did he make them?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      He made them for his own glory, and<br /> no man should disgrace his
      parents by denying it.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Were the people after
      the flood just as<br /> bad as they were before?<br /> <br /> 375<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. About the same.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did they try to
      circumvent God?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. They did.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      How?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. They got together for the purpose of build-<br />
      ing a tower, the top of which should reach to heaven,<br /> so that they
      could laugh at any future floods, and go<br /> to heaven at any time they
      desired.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did God hear about this?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. He did.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What did he say?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He said: "Go to; let us go down," and<br /> see what
      the people are doing; I am satisfied they<br /> will succeed.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      How were the people prevented from<br /> succeeding?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      God confounded their language, so that<br /> the mason on top could not cry
      "mort'!" to the<br /> hod-carrier below; he could not think of the word<br />
      to use, to save his life, and the building stopped.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      If it had not been for the confusion of<br /> tongues at Babel, do you
      really think that all the<br /> people in the world would have spoken just
      the same<br /> language, and would have pronounced every word<br />
      precisely the same?<br /> <br /> 376<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. If it had not been, then, for the con-<br /> fusion
      of languages, spelling books, grammars and<br /> dictionaries would have
      been useless?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I suppose so.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do any two people in the whole world<br /> speak the same language, now?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course they don't, and this is one of<br /> the
      great evidences that God introduced confusion<br /> into the languages.
      Every error in grammar, every<br /> mistake in spelling, every blunder in
      pronunciation,<br /> proves the truth of the Babel story.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      This being so, this miracle is the best<br /> attested of all?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. I suppose it is.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you not
      think that a confusion of<br /> tongues would bring men together instead of
      separa-<br /> ting them? Would not a man unable to converse<br /> with his
      fellow feel weak instead of strong; and<br /> would not people whose
      language had been con-<br /> founded cling together for mutual support?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. According to nature, yes; according to<br /> theology,
      no; and these questions must be answered<br /> according to theology. And
      right here, it may be<br /> well enough to state, that in theology the
      unnatural<br /> <br /> 377<br /> <br /> is the probable, and the impossible is
      what has always<br /> happened. If theology were simply natural, anybody<br />
      could be a theologian.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did God ever make any
      other special<br /> efforts to convert the people, or to reform the world?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes, he destroyed the cities of Sodom<br /> and
      Gomorrah with a storm of fire and brimstone.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do you suppose it was really brim-<br /> stone?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Undoubtedly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you think this brimstone came
      from<br /> the clouds?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Let me tell you that you
      have no right<br /> to examine the Bible in the light of what people are<br />
      pleased to call "science." The natural has nothing<br /> to do with the
      supernatural. Naturally there would<br /> be no brimstone in the clouds,
      but supernaturally<br /> there might be. God could make brimstone out of<br />
      his "omnipotence." We do not know really what<br /> brimstone is, and
      nobody knows exactly how brim-<br /> stone is made. As a matter of fact,
      all the brimstone<br /> in the world might have fallen at that time.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you think that Lot's wife was<br /> changed into
      salt?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course she was. A miracle was per-<br />
      <br /> 378<br /> <br /> formed. A few centuries ago, the statue of salt made<br />
      by changing Lot's wife into that article, was standing.<br /> Christian
      travelers have seen it.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why do you think she
      was changed<br /> into salt?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. For the purpose of
      keeping the event<br /> fresh in the minds of men.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      God having failed to keep people in-<br /> nocent in a garden; having
      failed to govern them<br /> outside of a garden; having failed to reform
      them by<br /> water; having failed to produce any good result by a<br />
      confusion of tongues; having failed to reform them<br /> with fire and
      brimstone, what did he then do?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He concluded
      that he had no time to<br /> waste on them all, but that he would have to
      select<br /> one tribe, and turn his entire attention to just a few<br />
      folks.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Whom did he select?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      A man by the name of Abram.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What kind of man
      was Abram?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. If you wish to know, read the twelfth<br />
      chapter of Genesis; and if you still have any doubts<br /> as to his
      character, read the twentieth chapter of the<br /> same book, and you will
      see that he was a man who<br /> made merchandise of his wife's body. He had
      had<br /> <br /> 379<br /> <br /> such good fortune in Egypt, that he tried
      the experi-<br /> ment again on Abimelech.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did
      Abraham show any gratitude?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes; he offered to
      sacrifice his son, to<br /> show his confidence in Jehovah.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      What became of Abraham and his<br /> people?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. God
      took such care of them, that in<br /> about two hundred and fifteen years
      they were all<br /> slaves in the land of Egypt.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      How long did they remain in slavery?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Two hundred
      and fifteen years.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Were they the same people
      that God<br /> had promised to take care of?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. They
      were.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Was God at that time, in favor of<br />
      slavery?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Not at that time. He was angry at the<br />
      Egyptians for enslaving the Jews, but he afterwards<br /> authorized the
      Jews to enslave other people.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What means did
      he take to liberate<br /> the Jews?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He sent his
      agents to Pharaoh, and de-<br /> manded their freedom; and upon Pharaoh s
      refusing,<br /> he afflicted the people, who had nothing to do with<br />
      <br /> 380<br /> <br /> it, with various plagues,&mdash;killed children, and
      tor-<br /> mented and tortured beasts.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Was such
      conduct Godlike?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly. If you have anything
      against<br /> your neighbor, it is perfectly proper to torture his<br />
      horse, or torment his dog. Nothing can be nobler<br /> than this. You see
      it is much better to injure his<br /> animals than to injure him. To punish
      animals for<br /> the sins of their owners must be just, or God would<br />
      not have done it. Pharaoh insisted on keeping the<br /> people in slavery,
      and therefore God covered the<br /> bodies of oxen and cows with boils. He
      also bruised<br /> them to death with hailstones. From this we infer,<br />
      that "the loving kindness of God is over all his works."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do you consider such treatment of ani-<br /> mals consistent with divine
      mercy?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly. You know that under the<br />
      Mosaic dispensation, when a man did a wrong, he<br /> could settle with God
      by killing an ox, or a sheep,<br /> or some doves. If the man failed to
      kill them, of<br /> course God would kill them. It was upon this prin-<br />
      ciple that he destroyed the animals of the Egyptians.<br /> They had
      sinned, and he merely took his pay.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How was it
      possible, under the old dis-<br /> pensation, to please a being of infinite
      kindness?<br /> <br /> 381<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. All you had to do was
      to take an innocent<br /> animal, bring it to the altar, cut its throat,
      and sprinkle<br /> the altar with its blood. Certain parts of it were to be<br />
      given to the butcher as his share, and the rest was to<br /> be burnt on
      the altar. When God saw an animal thus<br /> butchered, and smelt the warm
      blood mingled with<br /> the odor of burning flesh, he was pacified, and
      the<br /> smile of forgiveness shed its light upon his face.<br /> Of
      course, infidels laugh at these things; but what<br /> can you expect of
      men who have not been "born<br /> "again"? "The carnal mind is enmity with
      God."<br /> <i>Question</i>. What else did God do in order to in-<br /> duce
      Pharaoh to liberate the Jews?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He had his agents
      throw down a cane<br /> in the presence of Pharaoh and thereupon Jehovah<br />
      changed this cane into a serpent.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did this
      convince Pharaoh?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No; he sent for his own
      magicians.<br /> <i>Question</i>. What did they do?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      They threw down some canes and they<br /> also were changed into serpents.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did Jehovah change the canes of the<br /> Egyptian
      magicians into snakes?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I suppose he did, as he
      is the only one<br /> capable of performing such a miracle.<br /> <br /> 382<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. If the rod of Aaron was changed into<br /> a serpent
      in order to convince Pharaoh that God had<br /> sent Aaron and Moses, why
      did God change the<br /> sticks of the Egyptian magicians into serpents&mdash;why<br />
      did he discredit his own agents, and render worth-<br /> less their only
      credentials?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Well, we cannot explain the conduct
      of<br /> Jehovah; we are perfectly satisfied that it was for<br /> the best.
      Even in this age of the world God allows<br /> infidels to overwhelm his
      chosen people with argu-<br /> ments; he allows them to discover facts that
      his<br /> ministers can not answer, and yet we are satisfied<br /> that in
      the end God will give the victory to us. All<br /> these things are tests
      of faith. It is upon this prin-<br /> ciple that God allows geology to
      laugh at Genesis,<br /> that he permits astronomy apparently to contradict<br />
      his holy word.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What did God do with these
      people<br /> after Pharaoh allowed them to go?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Finding that they were not fit to settle<br /> a new country, owing to the
      fact that when hungry<br /> they longed for food, and sometimes when their
      lips<br /> were cracked with thirst insisted on having water,<br /> God in
      his infinite mercy had them marched round<br /> and round, back and forth,
      through a barren wilder-<br /> <br /> 383<br /> <br /> ness, until all, with
      the exception of two persons,<br /> died.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why
      did he do this?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Because he had promised these
      people<br /> that he would take them "to a land flowing with<br /> "milk and
      honey."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Was God always patient and kind and<br />
      merciful toward his children while they were in the<br /> wilderness?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes, he always was merciful and kind<br /> and
      patient. Infidels have taken the ground that he<br /> visited them with
      plagues and disease and famine;<br /> that he had them bitten by serpents,
      and now and<br /> then allowed the ground to swallow a few thousands<br />
      of them, and in other ways saw to it that they were<br /> kept as
      comfortable and happy as was consistent with<br /> good government; but all
      these things were for their<br /> good; and the fact is, infidels have no
      real sense of<br /> justice.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How did God happen
      to treat the Is-<br /> raelites in this way, when he had promised Abraham<br />
      that he would take care of his progeny, and when he<br /> had promised the
      same to the poor wretches while<br /> they were slaves in Egypt?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. Because God is unchangeable in his na-<br /> <br /> 384<br />
      <br /> ture, and wished to convince them that every being<br /> should be
      perfectly faithful to his promise.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Was God
      driven to madness by the<br /> conduct of his chosen people?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Almost.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did he know exactly what they would<br />
      do when he chose them?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Exactly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Were the Jews guilty of idolatry?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. They were.
      They worshiped other gods<br /> &mdash;gods made of wood and stone.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is it not wonderful that they were not<br />
      convinced of the power of God, by the many mira-<br /> cles wrought in
      Egypt and in the wilderness?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes, it is very
      wonderful; but the Jews,<br /> who must have seen bread rained from heaven;
      who<br /> saw water gush from the rocks and follow them up hill<br /> and
      down; who noticed that their clothes did not<br /> wear out, and did not
      even get shiny at the knees,<br /> while the elbows defied the ravages of
      time, and<br /> their shoes remained perfect for forty years; it is<br />
      wonderful that when they saw the ground open<br /> and swallow their
      comrades; when they saw God<br /> talking face to face with Moses as a man
      talks with<br /> his friend; after they saw the cloud by day and the<br />
      <br /> 385<br /> <br /> pillar of fire by night,&mdash;it is absolutely
      astonishing<br /> that they had more faith in a golden calf that they<br />
      made themselves, than in Jehovah.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How is it
      that the Jews had no confi-<br /> dence in these miracles?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Because they were there and saw them.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you
      think that it is necessary for<br /> us to believe all the miracles of the
      Old Testament<br /> in order to be saved?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The Old
      Testament is the foundation of<br /> the New. If the Old Testament is not
      inspired, then<br /> the New is of no value. If the Old Testament is<br />
      inspired, all the miracles are true, and we cannot<br /> believe that God
      would allow any errors, or false<br /> statements, to creep into an
      inspired volume, and to<br /> be perpetuated through all these years.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Should we believe the miracles, whether<br /> they
      are reasonable or not?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly; if they were
      reasonable, they<br /> would not be miracles. It is their unreasonableness<br />
      that appeals to our credulity and our faith. It is im-<br /> possible to
      have theological faith in anything that<br /> can be demonstrated. It is
      the office of faith to<br /> believe, not only without evidence, but in
      spite of<br /> evidence. It is impossible for the carnal mind to<br /> <br />
      386<br /> <br /> believe that Samsons muscle depended upon the<br /> length
      of his hair. "God has made the wisdom of<br /> "this world foolishness."
      Neither can the uncon-<br /> verted believe that Elijah stopped at a hotel
      kept by<br /> ravens. Neither can they believe that a barrel would<br /> in
      and of itself produce meal, or that an earthen pot<br /> could create oil.
      But to a Christian, in order that a<br /> widow might feed a preacher, the
      truth of these<br /> stories is perfectly apparent.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      How should we regard the wonderful<br /> stories of the Old Testament?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. They should be looked upon as "types"<br /> and
      "symbols." They all have a spiritual signifi-<br /> cance. The reason I
      believe the story of Jonah is,<br /> that Jonah is a type of Christ.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you believe the story of Jonah to<br /> be a true
      account of a literal fact?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly. You must
      remember that<br /> Jonah was not swallowed by a whale. God "pre-<br />
      "pared a great fish" for that occasion. Neither is it by<br /> any means
      certain that Jonah was in the belly of<br /> this whale. "He probably
      stayed in his mouth."<br /> Even if he was in his stomach, it was very easy<br />
      for him to defy the ordinary action of gastric juice<br /> by rapidly
      walking up and down..<br /> <br /> 387<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you
      think that Jonah was really in<br /> the whale's stomach?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      My own opinion is that he stayed in his<br /> mouth. The only objection to
      this theory is, that it<br /> is more reasonable than the other and
      requires less<br /> faith. Nothing could be easier than for God to make<br />
      a fish large enough to furnish ample room for one<br /> passenger in his
      mouth. I throw out this suggestion<br /> simply that you may be able to
      answer the objections<br /> of infidels who are always laughing at this
      story.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you really believe that Elijah went<br />
      to heaven in a chariot of fire, drawn by horses of<br /> fire?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. Of course he did.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What was this
      miracle performed for?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. To convince the people of
      the power of<br /> God.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Who saw the miracle?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Nobody but Elisha.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Was he
      convinced before that time?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Oh yes; he was one
      of God's prophets.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Suppose that in these days
      two men<br /> should leave a town together, and after a while one<br /> of
      them should come back having on the clothes of<br /> the other, and should
      account for the fact that he had<br /> <br /> 388<br /> <br /> his friend's
      clothes by saying that while they were<br /> going along the road together
      a chariot of fire came<br /> down from heaven drawn by fiery steeds, and
      there-<br /> upon his friend got into the carriage, threw him his<br />
      clothes, and departed,&mdash;would you believe it?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Of course things like that don't happen<br /> in these days; God does not
      have to rely on wonders<br /> now.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you mean
      that he performs no<br /> miracles at the present day?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      We cannot say that he does not perform<br /> miracles now, but we are not
      in position to call atten-<br /> tion to any particular one. Of course he
      supervises<br /> the affairs of nations and men and does whatever in<br />
      his judgment is necessary.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you think that
      Samson's strength<br /> depended on the length of his hair?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      The Bible so states, and the Bible is true.<br /> A physiologist might say
      that a man could not use<br /> the muscle in his hair for lifting purposes,
      but these<br /> same physiologists could not tell you how you move<br /> a
      finger, nor how you lift a feather; still, actuated by<br /> the pride of
      intellect, they insist that the length of a<br /> man's hair could not
      determine his strength. God<br /> says it did; the physiologist says that
      it did not; we<br /> <br /> 389<br /> <br /> can not hesitate whom to believe.
      For the purpose<br /> of avoiding eternal agony I am willing to believe<br />
      anything; I am willing to say that strength depends<br /> upon the length
      of hair, or faith upon the length of<br /> ears. I am perfectly willing to
      believe that a man<br /> caught three hundred foxes, and put fire brands
      be-<br /> tween their tails; that he slew thousands with a bone,<br /> and
      that he made a bee hive out of a lion. I will<br /> believe, if necessary,
      that when this man's hair was<br /> short he hardly had strength enough to
      stand, and<br /> that when it was long, he could carry away the gates<br />
      of a city, or overthrow a temple filled with people.<br /> If the infidel
      is right, I will lose nothing by believing,<br /> but if he is wrong, I
      shall gain an eternity of joy.<br /> If God did not intend that we should
      believe these<br /> stories, he never would have told them, and why<br />
      should a man put his soul in peril by trying to dis-<br /> prove one of the
      statements of the Lord?<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Suppose it should turn
      out that some<br /> of these miracles depend upon mistranslations of the<br />
      original Hebrew, should we still believe them?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      The safe side is the best side. It is<br /> far better to err on the side
      of belief, than on the<br /> side of infidelity. God does not threaten
      anybody<br /> with eternal punishment for believing too much.<br /> <br />
      390<br /> <br /> Danger lies on the side of investigation, on the<br /> side
      of thought. The perfectly idiotic are absolutely<br /> safe. As they
      diverge from that point,&mdash;as they rise<br /> in the intellectual
      scale, as the brain develops, as the<br /> faculties enlarge, the danger
      increases. I know that<br /> some biblical students now take the ground
      that<br /> Samson caught no foxes,&mdash;that he only took sheaves<br /> of
      wheat that had been already cut and bound, set<br /> them on fire, and
      threw them into the grain still<br /> standing. If this is what he did, of
      course there is<br /> nothing miraculous about it, and the value of the<br />
      story is lost. So, others contend that Elijah was not<br /> fed by the
      ravens, but by the Arabs. They tell us<br /> that the Hebrew word standing
      for "Arab" also<br /> stands for "bird," and that the word really means<br />
      "migratory&mdash;going from place to place&mdash;homeless."<br /> But I
      prefer the old version. It certainly will do no<br /> harm to believe that
      ravens brought bread and flesh<br /> to a prophet of God. Where they got
      their bread<br /> and flesh is none of my business; how they knew<br />
      where the prophet was, and recognized him; or how<br /> God talks to
      ravens, or how he gave them directions,<br /> I have no right to inquire. I
      leave these questions<br /> to the scientists, the blasphemers, and
      thinkers.<br /> There are many people in the church anxious to<br /> <br />
      391<br /> <br /> get the miracles out of the Bible, and thousands,<br /> I
      have no doubt, would be greatly gratified to learn<br /> that there is, in
      fact, nothing miraculous in Scripture;<br /> but when you take away the
      miraculous, you take<br /> away the supernatural; when you take away the<br />
      supernatural, you destroy the ministry; and when<br /> you take away the
      ministry, hundreds of thousands<br /> of men will be left without
      employment.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is it not wonderful that the
      Egyptians<br /> were not converted by the miracles wrought in their<br />
      country?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes, they all would have been, if God<br />
      had not purposely hardened their hearts to prevent<br /> it. Jehovah always
      took great delight in furnishing<br /> the evidence, and then hardening the
      man's heart so<br /> that he would not believe it. After all the miracles<br />
      that had been performed in Egypt,&mdash;the most won-<br /> derful that
      were ever done in any country, the<br /> Egyptians were as unbelieving as
      at first; they pur-<br /> sued the Israelites, knowing that they were
      protected<br /> by an infinite God, and failing to overwhelm them,<br />
      came back and worshiped their own false gods just as<br /> firmly as
      before. All of which shows the unreason-<br /> ableness of a Pagan, and the
      natural depravity of<br /> human nature.<br /> <br /> 392<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      How did it happen that the Canaanites<br /> were never convinced that the
      Jews were assisted by<br /> Jehovah?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. They must
      have been an exceedingly<br /> brave people to contend so many years with
      the<br /> chosen people of God. Notwithstanding all their<br /> cities were
      burned time and time again; notwith-<br /> standing all the men, women and
      children were put<br /> to the edge of the sword; notwithstanding the
      taking<br /> of all their cattle and sheep, they went right on<br />
      fighting just as valiantly and desperately as ever.<br /> Each one lost his
      life many times, and was just as<br /> ready for the next conflict. My own
      opinion is, that<br /> God kept them alive by raising them from the dead<br />
      after each battle, for the purpose of punishing the<br /> Jews. God used
      his enemies as instruments for the<br /> civilization of the Jewish people.
      He did not wish<br /> to convert them, because they would give him much<br />
      more trouble as Jews than they did as Canaanites.<br /> He had all the Jews
      he could conveniently take care<br /> of. He found it much easier to kill a
      hundred<br /> Canaanites than to civilize one Jew.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      How do you account for the fact that<br /> the heathen were not surprised
      at the stopping of the<br /> sun and moon?<br /> <br /> 393<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      They were so ignorant that they had<br /> not the slightest conception of
      the real cause of<br /> the phenomenon. Had they known the size of<br /> the
      earth, and the relation it sustained to the other<br /> heavenly bodies;
      had they known the magnitude of<br /> the sun, and the motion of the moon,
      they would,<br /> in all probability, have been as greatly astonished as<br />
      the Jews were; but being densely ignorant of as-<br /> tronomy, it must
      have produced upon them not the<br /> slightest impression. But we must
      remember that<br /> the sun and moon were not stopped for the purpose<br />
      of converting these people, but to give Joshua more<br /> time to kill
      them. As soon as we see clearly the<br /> purpose of Jehovah, we instantly
      perceive how ad-<br /> mirable were the means adopted.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do you not consider the treatment<br /> of the Canaanites to have been
      cruel and ferocious?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. To a totally depraved man,
      it does look<br /> cruel; to a being without any good in him,&mdash;to one<br />
      who has inherited the rascality of many generations,<br /> the murder of
      innocent women and little children<br /> does seem horrible; to one who is
      "contaminated in<br /> "all his parts," by original sin,&mdash;who was
      "conceived<br /> "in sin, and brought forth in iniquity," the assassina-<br />
      tion of men, and the violation of captive maidens,<br /> <br /> 394<br />
      <br /> do not seem consistent with infinite goodness. But<br /> when one has
      been "born again," when "the love<br /> "of God has been shed abroad in his
      heart," when<br /> he loves all mankind, when he "overcomes evil with<br />
      "good," when he "prays for those who despite-<br /> "fully use him and
      persecute him,"&mdash;to such a man,<br /> the extermination of the
      Canaanites, the violation<br /> of women, the slaughter of babes, and the
      destruc-<br /> tion of countless thousands, is the highest evidence<br /> of
      the goodness, the mercy, and the long-suffering<br /> of God. When a man
      has been "born again," all<br /> the passages of the Old Testament that
      appear so<br /> horrible and so unjust to one in his natural state,<br />
      become the dearest, the most consoling, and the<br /> most beautiful of
      truths. The real Christian reads<br /> the accounts of these ancient
      battles with the greatest<br /> possible satisfaction. To one who really
      loves his<br /> enemies, the groans of men, the shrieks of women,<br /> and
      the cries of babes, make music sweeter than the<br /> zephyr's breath.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. In your judgment, why did God destroy<br /> the
      Canaanites?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. To prevent their contaminating his<br />
      chosen people. He knew that if the Jews were<br /> allowed to live with
      such neighbors, they would<br /> <br /> 395<br /> <br /> finally become as bad
      as the Canaanites themselves.<br /> He wished to civilize his chosen
      people, and it was<br /> therefore necessary for him to destroy the
      heathen.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did God succeed in civilizing the
      Jews<br /> after he had "removed" the Canaanites?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Well, not entirely. He had to allow the<br /> heathen he had not destroyed
      to overrun the whole<br /> land and make captives of the Jews. This was
      done<br /> for the good of his chosen people.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Did he then succeed in civilizing them?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Not quite.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did he ever quite succeed in civilizing<br /> them?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Well, we must admit that the experi-<br /> ment never
      was a conspicuous success. The Jews<br /> were chosen by the Almighty 430
      years before he<br /> appeared to Moses on Mount Sinai. He was their<br />
      direct Governor. He attended personally to their<br /> religion and
      politics, and gave up a great part of his<br /> valuable time for about two
      thousand years, to the<br /> management of their affairs; and yet, such was
      the<br /> condition of the Jewish people, after they had had all<br /> these
      advantages, that when there arose among them<br /> a perfectly kind, just,
      generous and honest man, these<br /> people, with whom God had been
      laboring for so<br /> <br /> 396<br /> <br /> many centuries, deliberately put
      to death that good<br /> and loving man.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you
      think that God really endeav-<br /> ored to civilize the Jews?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. This is an exceedingly hard question.<br /> If he had really
      tried to do it, of course he could<br /> have done it. We must not think of
      limiting the<br /> power of the infinite. But you must remember that<br />
      if he had succeeded in civilizing the Jews, if he had<br /> educated them
      up to the plane of intellectual liberty,<br /> and made them just and kind
      and merciful, like him-<br /> self, they would not have crucified Christ,
      and you<br /> can see at once the awful condition in which we<br /> would
      all be to-day. No atonement could have<br /> been made; and if no atonement
      had been made,<br /> then, according to the Christian system, the whole<br />
      world would have been lost. We must admit that<br /> there was no time in
      the history of the Jews from<br /> Sinai to Jerusalem, that they would not
      have put a<br /> man like Christ to death.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. So
      you think that, after all, it was not<br /> God's intention that the Jews
      should become civilized?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. We do not know. We can
      only say<br /> that "God's ways are not our ways." It may be<br /> that God
      took them in his special charge, for the<br /> <br /> 397<br /> <br /> purpose
      of keeping them bad enough to make the<br /> necessary sacrifice. That may
      have been the divine<br /> plan. In any event, it is safer to believe the
      explana-<br /> tion that is the most unreasonable.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do you think that Christ knew the<br /> Jews would crucify him?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. Certainly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you think that
      when he chose<br /> Judas he knew that he would betray him?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Certainly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did he know when Judas went to the<br />
      chief priest and made the bargain for the delivery<br /> of Christ?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why did he
      allow himself to be be-<br /> trayed, if he knew the plot?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Infidelity is a very good doctrine to live<br /> by, but you should read
      the last words of Paine and<br /> Voltaire.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If
      Christ knew that Judas would betray<br /> him, why did he choose him?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Nothing can exceed the atrocities of the<br /> French
      Revolution&mdash;when they carried a woman<br /> through the streets and
      worshiped her as the goddess<br /> of Reason.<br /> <br /> 398<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Would not the mission of Christ have<br /> been a failure had no one
      betrayed him?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Thomas Paine was a drunkard, and
      re-<br /> canted on his death-bed, and died a blaspheming<br /> infidel
      besides.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is it not clear that an atonement was<br />
      necessary; and is it not equally clear that the atone-<br /> ment could not
      have been made unless somebody<br /> had betrayed Christ; and unless the
      Jews had been<br /> wicked and orthodox enough to crucify him?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. Of course the atonement had to be<br /> made. It was a part
      of the "divine plan" that Christ<br /> should be betrayed, and that the
      Jews should be<br /> wicked enough to kill him. Otherwise, the world<br />
      would have been lost.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Suppose Judas had
      understood the<br /> divine plan, what ought he to have done? Should<br />
      he have betrayed Christ, or let somebody else do it;<br /> or should he
      have allowed the world to perish, in-<br /> cluding his own soul?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. If you take the Bible away from the<br /> world, "how
      would it be possible to have witnesses<br /> "sworn in courts;" how would
      it be possible to ad-<br /> minister justice?<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      If Christ had not been betrayed and<br /> <br /> 399<br /> <br /> crucified,
      is it true that his own mother would be in<br /> perdition to-day?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Most assuredly. There was but one<br /> way by which
      she could be saved, and that was by<br /> the death of her son&mdash;through
      the blood of the<br /> atonement. She was totally depraved through the<br />
      sin of Adam, and deserved eternal death. Even her<br /> love for the infant
      Christ was, in the sight of God,&mdash;<br /> that is to say, of her babe,&mdash;wickedness.
      It can not<br /> be repeated too often that there is only one way to<br />
      be saved, and that is, to believe in the Lord Jesus<br /> Christ.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Could Christ have prevented the Jews<br /> from
      crucifying him?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He could.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      If he could have saved his life and did<br /> not, was he not guilty of
      suicide?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No one can understand these questions<br />
      who has not read the prophecies of Daniel, and has<br /> not a clear
      conception of what is meant by "the full-<br /> "ness of time."<br /> <br />
      <i>Question</i>. What became of all the Canaanites, the<br /> Egyptians,
      the Hindus, the Greeks and Romans and<br /> Chinese? What became of the
      billions who died<br /> before the promise was made to Abraham; of the<br />
      <br /> 400<br /> <br /> billions and billions who never heard of the Bible,<br />
      who never heard the name, even, of Jesus Christ&mdash;<br /> never knew of
      "the scheme of salvation"? What<br /> became of the millions and billions
      who lived in this<br /> hemisphere, and of whose existence Jehovah himself<br />
      seemed perfectly ignorant?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. They were undoubtedly
      lost. God<br /> having made them, had a right to do with them as<br /> he
      pleased. They are probably all in hell to-day, and<br /> the fact that they
      are damned, only adds to the joy<br /> of the redeemed. It is by contrast
      that we are able<br /> to perceive the infinite kindness with which God has<br />
      treated us.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is it not possible that something
      can<br /> be done for a human soul in another world as well as<br /> in
      this?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No; this is the only world in which<br />
      God even attempts to reform anybody. In the<br /> other world, nothing is
      done for the purpose of<br /> making anybody better. Here in this world,
      where<br /> man lives but a few days, is the only opportunity<br /> for
      moral improvement. A minister can do a thou-<br /> sand times more for a
      soul than its creator; and this<br /> country is much better adapted to
      moral growth than<br /> heaven itself. A person who lived on this earth a<br />
      <br /> 401<br /> <br /> few years, and died without having been converted,<br />
      has no hope in another world. The moment he arrives<br /> at the judgment
      seat, nothing remains but to damn<br /> him. Neither God, nor the Holy
      Ghost, nor Jesus<br /> Christ, can have the least possible influence with<br />
      him there.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. When God created each human being,<br />
      did he know exactly what would be his eternal fate?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Most assuredly he did.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did he know that
      hundreds and millions<br /> and billions would suffer eternal pain?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly. But he gave them freedom<br /> of choice
      between good and evil.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did he know exactly how
      they would<br /> use that freedom?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did he know that billions would use<br /> it wrong?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Was it optional with
      him whether he<br /> should make such people or not?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Certainly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Had these people any option as to<br />
      whether they would be made or not?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>, No.<br />
      <br /> 402<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Would it not have been far better to<br />
      leave them unconscious dust?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. These questions
      show how foolish it is<br /> to judge God according to a human standard.
      What<br /> to us seems just and merciful, God may regard in an<br /> exactly
      opposite light; and we may hereafter be<br /> developed to such a degree
      that we will regard the<br /> agonies of the damned as the highest possible
      evi-<br /> dence of the goodness and mercy of God.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      How do you account for the fact that<br /> God did not make himself known
      except to Abra-<br /> ham and his descendants? Why did he fail to<br />
      reveal himself to the other nations&mdash;nations that,<br /> compared with
      the Jews, were learned, cultivated<br /> and powerful? Would you regard a
      revelation now<br /> made to the Esquimaux as intended for us; and<br />
      would it be a revelation of which we would be<br /> obliged to take notice?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course, God could have revealed him-<br /> self,
      not only to all the great nations, but to each<br /> individual. He could
      have had the Ten Command-<br /> ments engraved on every heart and brain; or
      he<br /> could have raised up prophets in every land; but<br /> he chose,
      rather, to allow countless millions of his<br /> children to wander in the
      darkness and blackness of<br /> <br /> 403<br /> <br /> Nature; chose, rather,
      that they should redden their<br /> hands in each other's blood; chose,
      rather, that they<br /> should live without light, and die without hope;<br />
      chose, rather, that they should suffer, not only in this<br /> world, but
      forever in the next. Of course we have<br /> no right to find fault with
      the choice of God.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Now you can tell a sinner
      to "believe<br /> "on the Lord Jesus Christ;" what could a sinner have<br />
      been told in Egypt, three thousand years ago; and<br /> in what language
      would you have addressed a Hindu<br /> in the days of Buddha&mdash;the
      "divine scheme" at that<br /> time being a secret in the divine breast?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. It is not for us to think upon these<br /> questions.
      The moment we examine the Christian<br /> system, we begin to doubt. In a
      little while, we shall<br /> be infidels, and shall lose the respect of
      those who<br /> refuse to think. It is better to go with the majority.<br />
      These doctrines are too sacred to be touched. You<br /> should be satisfied
      with the religion of your father<br /> and your mother. "You want some book
      on the<br /> "centre-table," in the parlor; it is extremely handy<br /> to
      have a Family Record; and what book, other than<br /> the Bible, could a
      mother give a son as he leaves the<br /> old homestead?<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Is it not wonderful that all the writers<br /> <br /> 404<br /> <br /> of the
      four gospels do not give an account of the<br /> ascension of Jesus Christ?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. This question has been answered long<br /> ago, time
      and time again.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Perhaps it has, but would it
      not be<br /> well enough to answer it once more? Some may<br /> not have
      seen the answer?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Show me the hospitals that
      infidels<br /> have built; show me the asylums that infidels<br /> have
      founded.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. I know you have given the usual an-<br />
      swer; but after all, is it not singular that a miracle<br /> so wonderful
      as the bodily ascension of a man, should<br /> not have been mentioned by
      all the writers of that<br /> man's life? Is it not wonderful that some of
      them<br /> said that he did ascend, and others that he agreed to<br /> stay
      with his disciples always?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. People unacquainted
      with the Hebrew,<br /> can have no conception of these things. A story<br />
      in plain English, does not sound as it does in Hebrew.<br /> Miracles seem
      altogether more credible, when told in<br /> a dead language.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      What, in your judgment, became of<br /> the dead who were raised by Christ?
      Is it not<br /> singular that they were never mentioned afterward?<br />
      <br /> 405<br /> <br /> Would not a man who had been raised from the<br />
      dead naturally be an object of considerable interest,<br /> especially to
      his friends and acquaintances? And<br /> is it not also wonderful that
      Christ, after having<br /> wrought so many miracles, cured so many lame and<br />
      halt and blind, fed so many thousands miraculously,<br /> and after having
      entered Jerusalem in triumph as a<br /> conqueror and king, had to be
      pointed out by one<br /> of his own disciples who was bribed for the
      purpose?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course, all these things are exceed-<br />
      ingly wonderful, and if found in any other book,<br /> would be absolutely
      incredible; but we have no<br /> right to apply the same kind of reasoning
      to the<br /> Bible that we apply to the Koran or to the sacred<br /> books
      of the Hindus. For the ordinary affairs of<br /> this world, God has given
      us reason; but in the<br /> examination of religious questions, we should
      de-<br /> pend upon credulity and faith.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If
      Christ came to offer himself a sacri-<br /> fice, for the purpose of making
      atonement for the<br /> sins of such as might believe on him, why did he<br />
      not make this fact known to all of his disciples?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      He did. This was, and is, the gospel.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How is
      it that Matthew says nothing<br /> about "salvation by faith," but simply
      says that God<br /> <br /> 406<br /> <br /> will be merciful to the merciful,
      that he will forgive<br /> the forgiving, and says not one word about the<br />
      necessity of believing anything?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. But you will
      remember that Mark says,<br /> in the last chapter of his gospel, that
      "whoso be-<br /> "lieveth not shall be damned."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do you admit that Matthew says<br /> nothing on the subject?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Yes, I suppose I must.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is not that passage in
      Mark generally<br /> admitted to be an interpolation?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Some biblical scholars say that it is.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is that
      portion of the last chapter of<br /> Mark found in the Syriac version of
      the Bible?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. It is not.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      If it was necessary to believe on Jesus<br /> Christ, in order to be saved,
      how is it that Matthew<br /> failed to say so?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      "There are more copies of the Bible<br /> "printed to-day, than of any
      other book in the world,<br /> "and it is printed in more languages than
      any other<br /> "book."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you consider it
      necessary to be<br /> "regenerated"&mdash;to be "born again"&mdash;in order
      to be<br /> saved?<br /> <br /> 407<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did Matthew say anything on the sub-<br /> ject of
      "regeneration"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Did Mark?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did
      Luke?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is Saint
      John the only one who speaks<br /> of the necessity of being "born again"?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He is.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you think that
      Matthew, Mark and<br /> Luke knew anything about the necessity of "regen-<br />
      "eration"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course they did.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Why did they fail to speak of it?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. There is no
      civilization without the Bible.<br /> The moment you throw away the sacred
      Scriptures,<br /> you are all at sea&mdash;you are without an anchor and<br />
      without a compass.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. You will remember that,
      according to<br /> Mark, Christ said to his disciples: "Go ye into all<br />
      "the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."<br /> Did he refer to
      the gospel set forth by Mark?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course he did.<br />
      <br /> 408<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Well, in the gospel set forth by
      Mark,<br /> there is not a word about "regeneration," and no<br /> word
      about the necessity of believing anything&mdash;ex-<br /> cept in an
      interpolated passage. Would it not seem<br /> from this, that
      "regeneration" and a "belief in the<br /> "Lord Jesus Christ," are no part
      of the gospel?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Nothing can exceed in horror the
      last<br /> moments of the infidel; nothing can be more ter-<br /> rible than
      the death of the doubter. When the<br /> glories of this world fade from
      the vision; when am-<br /> bition becomes an empty name; when wealth turns<br />
      to dust in the palsied hand of death, of what use is<br /> philosophy then?
      Who cares then for the pride of<br /> intellect? In that dread moment, man
      needs some-<br /> thing to rely on, whether it is true or not.<br /> <br />
      <i>Question</i>. Would it not have been more con-<br /> vincing if Christ,
      after his resurrection, had shown<br /> himself to his enemies as well as
      to his friends?<br /> Would it not have greatly strengthened the evidence<br />
      in the case, if he had visited Pilate; had presented<br /> himself before
      Caiaphas, the high priest; if he had<br /> again entered the temple, and
      again walked the<br /> streets of Jerusalem?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. If
      the evidence had been complete and<br /> overwhelming, there would have
      been no praise-<br /> <br /> 409<br /> <br /> worthiness in belief; even
      publicans and sinners<br /> would have believed, if the evidence had been
      suffi-<br /> cient. The amount of evidence required is the test<br /> of the
      true Christian spirit.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Would it not also have
      been better<br /> had the ascension taken place in the presence of<br />
      unbelieving thousands; it seems such a pity to have<br /> wasted such a
      demonstration upon those already<br /> convinced?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      These questions are the natural fruit of<br /> the carnal mind, and can be
      accounted for only by<br /> the doctrine of total depravity. Nothing has
      given<br /> the church more trouble than just such questions.<br /> Unholy
      curiosity, a disposition to pry into the divine<br /> mysteries, a desire
      to know, to investigate, to explain<br /> &mdash;in short, to understand,
      are all evidences of a re-<br /> probate mind.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      How can we account for the fact that<br /> Matthew alone speaks of the wise
      men of the East<br /> coming with gifts to the infant Christ; that he alone<br />
      speaks of the little babes being killed by Herod? Is<br /> it possible that
      the other writers never heard of these<br /> things?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Nobody can get any good out of the<br /> Bible by reading it in a critical
      spirit. The contra-<br /> <br /> 410<br /> <br /> dictions and discrepancies
      are only apparent, and melt<br /> away before the light of faith. That
      which in other<br /> books would be absolute and palpable contradiction,<br />
      is, in the Bible, when spiritually discerned, a perfect<br /> and beautiful
      harmony. My own opinion is, that<br /> seeming contradictions are in the
      Bible for the pur-<br /> pose of testing and strengthening the faith of
      Chris-<br /> tians, and for the further purpose of ensnaring infidels,<br />
      "that they might believe a lie and be damned."<br /> <i>Question</i>. Is it
      possible that a good God would<br /> take pains to deceive his children?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The Bible is filled with instances of that<br /> kind,
      and all orthodox ministers now know that<br /> fossil animals&mdash;that
      is, representations of animals in<br /> stone, were placed in the rocks on
      purpose to mis-<br /> lead men like Darwin and Humboldt, Huxley and<br />
      Tyndall. It is also now known that God, for the<br /> purpose of misleading
      the so-called men of science,<br /> had hairy elephants preserved in ice,
      made stomachs<br /> for them, and allowed twigs of trees to be found in<br />
      these stomachs, when, as a matter of fact, no such<br /> elephants ever
      lived or ever died. These men who<br /> are endeavoring to overturn the
      Scriptures with the<br /> lever of science will find that they have been
      de-<br /> ceived. Through all eternity they will regret their<br /> <br />
      411<br /> <br /> philosophy. They will wish, in the next world, that<br />
      they had thrown away geology and physiology and<br /> all other "ologies"
      except theology. The time is<br /> coming when Jehovah will "mock at their
      fears and<br /> "laugh at their calamity."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If
      Joseph was not the father of Christ,<br /> why was his genealogy given to
      show that Christ<br /> was of the blood of David; why would not the<br />
      genealogy of any other Jew have done as well?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      That objection was raised and answered<br /> hundreds of years ago.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. If they wanted to show that Christ was of<br /> the
      blood of David, why did they not give the gene-<br /> alogy of his mother
      if Joseph was not his father?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. That objection was
      answered hundreds<br /> of years ago.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How was
      it answered?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. When Voltaire was dying, he sent
      for a<br /> priest.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How does it happen that the
      two gene-<br /> alogies given do not agree?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Perhaps they were written by different<br /> persons.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Were both these persons inspired by<br /> the same God?<br /> <br /> 412<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why were the
      miracles recorded in the<br /> New Testament performed?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      The miracles were the evidence relied<br /> on to prove the supernatural
      origin and the divine<br /> mission of Jesus Christ.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Aside from the miracles, is there any<br /> evidence to show the
      supernatural origin or character<br /> of Jesus Christ?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Some have considered that his moral<br /> precepts are sufficient, of
      themselves, to show that<br /> he was divine.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Had all of his moral precepts been<br /> taught before he lived?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. The same things had been said, but they<br /> did not have
      the same meaning.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Does the fact that Buddha
      taught the<br /> same tend to show that he was of divine origin?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. Certainly not. The rules of evidence<br /> applicable to the
      Bible are not applicable to other<br /> books. We examine other books in
      the light of<br /> reason; the Bible is the only exception. So, we<br />
      should not judge of Christ as we do of any other<br /> man.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do you think that Christ wrought<br /> <br /> 413<br /> <br /> many of his
      miracles because he was good, charitable,<br /> and filled with pity?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Has he as much
      power now as he had<br /> when on earth?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Most
      assuredly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is he as charitable and pitiful
      now, as<br /> he was then?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Why does he not now cure the lame<br /> and the halt and the blind?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. It is well known that, when Julian the<br /> Apostate
      was dying, catching some of his own blood<br /> in his hand and throwing it
      into the air he exclaimed:<br /> "Galileean, thou hast conquered!"<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you consider it our duty to love our<br />
      neighbor?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Is virtue the same in all worlds?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Most
      assuredly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Are we under obligation to render
      good<br /> for evil, and to "pray for those who despitefully use us"?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Will Christians in
      heaven love their<br /> neighbors?<br /> <br /> 414<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Y es; if their neighbors are not in hell.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do
      good Christians pity sinners in this<br /> world?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Yes.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Because
      they regard them as being in<br /> great danger of the eternal wrath of
      God.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. After these sinners have died, and<br />
      been sent to hell, will the Christians in heaven then<br /> pity them?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No. Angels have no pity.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      If we are under obligation to love our<br /> enemies, is not God under
      obligation to love his?<br /> If we forgive our enemies, ought not God to
      forgive<br /> his? If we forgive those who injure us, ought not<br /> God to
      forgive those who have not injured him?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. God made
      us, and he has therefore the<br /> right to do with us as he pleases.
      Justice demands<br /> that he should damn all of us, and the few that he<br />
      will save will be saved through mercy and without<br /> the slightest
      respect to anything they may have done<br /> themselves. Such is the
      justice of God, that those<br /> in hell will have no right to complain,
      and those in<br /> heaven will have no right to be there. Hell is justice,<br />
      and salvation is charity.<br /> <br /> 415<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do
      you consider it possible for a law to<br /> be jusdy satisfied by the
      punishment of an innocent<br /> person?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Such is
      the scheme of the atonement.<br /> As man is held responsible for the sin
      of Adam, so<br /> he will be credited with the virtues of Christ; and<br />
      you can readily see that one is exactly as reasonable<br /> as the other.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Suppose a man honestly reads the New<br />
      Testament, and honestly concludes that it is not an<br /> inspired book;
      suppose he honestly makes up his<br /> mind that the miracles are not true;
      that the devil<br /> never really carried Christ to the pinnacle of the<br />
      temple; that devils were really never cast out of a<br /> man and allowed
      to take refuge in swine;&mdash;I say,<br /> suppose that he is honestly
      convinced that these<br /> things are not true, what ought he to say?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He ought to say nothing.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Suppose that the same man should read<br /> the Koran, and come to the
      conclusion that it is not<br /> an inspired book; what ought he to say?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He ought to say that it is not inspired;<br /> his
      fellow-men are entitled to his honest opinion, and<br /> it is his duty to
      do what he can do to destroy a per-<br /> nicious superstition.<br /> <br />
      416<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Suppose then, that a reader of the Bible,<br />
      having become convinced that it is not inspired&mdash;<br /> honestly
      convinced&mdash;says nothing&mdash;keeps his con-<br /> clusion absolutely
      to himself, and suppose he dies in<br /> that belief, can he be saved?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly not.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Has the
      honesty of his belief anything<br /> to do with his future condition?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Nothing whatever.,<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Suppose that he tried to believe, that<br /> he hated to disagree with his
      friends, and with his<br /> parents, but that in spite of himself he was
      forced to<br /> the conclusion that the Bible is not the inspired word<br />
      of God, would he then deserve eternal punishment?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Certainly he would.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Can a man control his
      belief?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He cannot&mdash;except as to the Bible.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you consider it just in God to<br /> create a man
      who cannot believe the Bible, and then<br /> damn him because he does not?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Such is my belief.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is it
      your candid opinion that a man<br /> who does not believe the Bible should
      keep his<br /> belief a secret from his fellow-men?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      It is.<br /> <br /> 417<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How do I know that you
      believe the<br /> Bible? You have told me that if you did not be-<br />
      lieve it, you would not tell me?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. There is no way
      for you to ascertain,<br /> except by taking my word for it.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      What will be the fate of a man who<br /> does not believe it, and yet
      pretends to believe it?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He will be damned.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Then hypocrisy will not save him?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      No.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. And if he does not believe it, and ad-<br />
      mits that he does not believe it, then his honesty will<br /> not save him?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No. Honesty on the wrong side is no<br /> better than
      hypocrisy on the right side.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do we know who
      wrote the gospels?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes; we do.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Are we absolutely sure who wrote<br /> them?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of
      course; we have the evidence as it<br /> has come to us through the
      Catholic Church.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Can we rely upon the Catholic
      Church<br /> now?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No; assuredly no! But we have
      the<br /> testimony of Polycarp and Iren&aelig;us and Clement,<br /> <br />
      418<br /> <br /> and others of the early fathers, together with that of<br />
      the Christian historian, Eusebius.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What do we
      really know about Polycarp?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. We know that he
      suffered martyrdom un-<br /> der Marcus Aurelius, and that for quite a time
      the fire<br /> refused to burn his body, the flames arching over him,<br />
      leaving him in a kind of fiery tent; and we also know<br /> that from his
      body came a fragrance like frankincense,<br /> and that the Pagans were so
      exasperated at seeing<br /> the miracle, that one of them thrust a sword
      through<br /> the body of Polycarp; that the blood flowed out and<br />
      extinguished the flames and that out of the wound<br /> flew the soul of
      the martyr in the form of a dove.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is that all
      we know about Polycarp?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes, with the exception
      of a few more<br /> like incidents.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do we know
      that Polycarp ever met<br /> St. John?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes;
      Eusebius says so.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Are we absolutely certain
      that he ever<br /> lived?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes, or Eusebius could
      not have written<br /> about him.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do we know
      anything of the character<br /> of Eusebius?<br /> <br /> 419<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Yes; we know that he was untruthful<br /> only when he wished to do good.
      But God can use<br /> even the dishonest. Other books have to be sub-<br />
      stantiated by truthful men, but such is the power of<br /> God, that he can
      establish the inspiration of the Bible<br /> by the most untruthful
      witnesses. If God's witnesses<br /> were honest, anybody could believe, and
      what be-<br /> comes of faith, one of the greatest virtues?<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Is the New Testament now the same as<br /> it was in the days of the early
      fathers?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly not. Many books now thrown<br />
      out, and not esteemed of divine origin, were esteemed<br /> divine by
      Polycarp and Iren&aelig;us and Clement and<br /> many of the early
      churches. These books are now<br /> called "apocryphal."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Have you not the same witnesses in<br /> favor of their authenticity, that
      you have in favor of<br /> the gospels?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Precisely
      the same. Except that they<br /> were thrown out.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Why were they thrown out?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Because the Catholic
      Church did not es-<br /> teem them inspired.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Did the Catholics decide for us which<br /> are the true gospels and which
      are the true epistles?<br /> <br /> 420<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes. The
      Catholic Church was then the<br /> only church, and consequently must have
      been the<br /> true church.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How did the
      Catholic Church select the<br /> true books?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Councils were called, and votes were<br /> taken, very much as we now pass
      resolutions in<br /> political meetings.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Was
      the Catholic Church infallible then?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. It was
      then, but it is not now.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If the Catholic
      Church at that time<br /> had thrown out the book of Revelation, would it<br />
      now be our duty to believe that book to have been<br /> inspired?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No, I suppose not.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is it
      not true that some of these books<br /> were adopted by exceedingly small
      majorities?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. It is.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      If the Epistle to the Hebrews and to<br /> the Romans, and the book of
      Revelation had been<br /> thrown out, could a man now be saved who honestly<br />
      believes the rest of the books?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. This is
      doubtful.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Were the men who picked out the in-<br />
      spired books inspired?<br /> <br /> 421<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. We cannot
      tell, but the probability is<br /> that they were.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do we know that they picked out the<br /> right ones?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Well, not exactly, but we believe that<br /> they did.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Are we certain that some of the books<br /> that were thrown out were not
      inspired?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Well, the only way to tell is to read<br />
      them carefully.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If upon reading these
      apocryphal books<br /> a man concludes that they are not inspired, will he
      be<br /> damned for that reason?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No. Certainly
      not.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If he concludes that some of them are<br />
      inspired, and believes them, will he then be damned<br /> for that belief?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Oh, no! Nobody is ever damned for<br /> believing too
      much.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Does the fact that the books now com-<br />
      prising the New Testament were picked out by the<br /> Catholic Church
      prevent their being examined now<br /> by an honest man, as they were
      examined at the time<br /> they were picked out?<br /> <br /> 422<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. No; not if the man comes to the con-<br /> clusion that they
      are inspired.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Does the fact that the Catholic
      Church<br /> picked them out and declared them to be inspired,<br /> render
      it a crime to examine them precisely as you<br /> would examine the books
      that the Catholic Church<br /> threw out and declared were not inspired?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I think it does.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. At the
      time the council was held in which<br /> it was determined which of the
      books of the New<br /> Testament are inspired, a respectable minority voted<br />
      against some that were finally decided to be inspired.<br /> If they were
      honest in the vote they gave, and died<br /> without changing their
      opinions, are they now in hell?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Well, they ought
      to be.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If those who voted to leave the book<br />
      of Revelation out of the canon, and the gospel of<br /> Saint John out of
      the canon, believed honestly that<br /> these were not inspired books, how
      should they have<br /> voted?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Well, I suppose a
      man ought to vote as<br /> he honestly believes&mdash;except in matters of
      religion.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If the Catholic Church was not
      infal-<br /> lible, is the question still open as to what books are,<br />
      and what are not, inspired?<br /> <br /> 423<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I
      suppose the question is still open&mdash;<br /> but it would be dangerous
      to decide it.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If, then, I examine all the
      books again,<br /> and come to the conclusion that some that were<br />
      thrown out were inspired, and some that were ac-<br /> cepted were not
      inspired, ought I to say so?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Not if it is
      contrary to the faith of your<br /> father, or calculated to interfere with
      your own po-<br /> litical prospects.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is it as
      great a sin to admit into the<br /> Bible books that are uninspired as to
      reject those<br /> that are inspired?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Well, it is
      a crime to reject an inspired<br /> book, no matter how unsatisfactory the
      evidence is<br /> for its inspiration, but it is not a crime to receive an<br />
      uninspired book. God damns nobody for believing<br /> too much. An excess
      of credulity is simply to err in<br /> the direction of salvation.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Suppose a man disbelieves in the inspira-<br /> tion
      of the New Testament&mdash;believes it to be entirely<br /> the work of
      uninspired men; and suppose he also be-<br /> lieves&mdash;but not from any
      evidence obtained in the New<br /> Testament&mdash;that Jesus Christ was
      the son of God, and<br /> that he made atonement for his soul, can he then
      be<br /> saved without a belief in the inspiration of the Bible?<br /> <br />
      424<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. This has not yet been decided by<br /> our
      church, and I do not wish to venture an<br /> opinion.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Suppose a man denies the inspiration<br /> of the Scriptures; suppose that
      he also denies the<br /> divinity of Jesus Christ; and suppose, further,
      that<br /> he acts precisely as Christ is said to have acted;<br /> suppose
      he loves his enemies, prays for those who<br /> despitefully use him, and
      does all the good he pos-<br /> sibly can, is it your opinion that such a
      man will be<br /> saved?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No, sir. There is "none
      other name<br /> "given under heaven and among men," whereby a<br /> sinner
      can be saved but the name of Christ.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Then it
      is your opinion that God<br /> would save a murderer who believed in
      Christ, and<br /> would damn another man, exactly like Christ, who<br />
      failed to believe in him?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes; because we have
      the blessed<br /> promise that, out of Christ, "our God is a consuming<br />
      "fire."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Suppose a man read the Bible care-<br />
      fully and honestly, and was not quite convinced that<br /> it was true, and
      that while examining the subject, he<br /> died; what then?<br /> <br /> 425<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I do not believe that God would allow<br /> him to
      examine the matter in another world, or to<br /> make up his mind in
      heaven. Of course, he would<br /> eternally perish.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Could Christ now furnish evidence<br /> enough to convince every human
      being of the truth<br /> of the Bible?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course
      he could, because he is in-<br /> finite.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Are
      any miracles performed now?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Oh, no!<br /> <br />
      <i>Question</i>. Have we any testimony, except human<br /> testimony, to
      substantiate any miracle?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Only human testimony.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do all men give the same force to the<br /> same
      evidence?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. By no means.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Have all honest men who have exam-<br /> ined the Bible believed it to be
      inspired?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course they have. Infidels are not<br />
      honest.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Could any additional evidence have<br />
      been furnished?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. With perfect ease.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Would God allow a soul to suffer<br /> <br /> 426<br /> <br /> eternal agony
      rather than furnish evidence of the<br /> truth of his Bible?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      God has furnished plenty of evidence,<br /> and altogether more than was
      really necessary. We<br /> should read the Bible in a believing spirit.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Are all parts of the inspired books<br /> equally
      true?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Necessarily.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      According to Saint Matthew, God<br /> promises to forgive all who will
      forgive others; not<br /> one word is said about believing in Christ, or
      believ-<br /> ing in the miracles, or in any Bible; did Matthew tell<br />
      the truth?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The Bible must be taken as a whole;<br />
      and if other conditions are added somewhere else,<br /> then you must
      comply with those other conditions.<br /> Matthew may not have stated all
      the conditions.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. I find in another part of the
      New<br /> Testament, that a young man came to Christ and<br /> asked him
      what was necessary for him to do in order<br /> that he might inherit
      eternal life. Christ did not tell<br /> him that he must believe the Bible,
      or that he must<br /> believe in him, or that he must keep the Sabbath-<br />
      day; was Christ honest with that young man?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Well, I suppose he was.<br /> <br /> 427<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. You
      will also recollect that Zaccheus<br /> said to Christ, that where he had
      wronged any man<br /> he had made restitution, and further, that half his<br />
      goods he had given to the poor; and you will re-<br /> member that Christ
      said to Zaccheus: "This day<br /> "hath salvation come to thy house." Why
      did not<br /> Christ tell Zaccheus that he "must be born again;"<br /> that
      he must "believe on the Lord Jesus Christ"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of
      course there are mysteries in our<br /> holy religion that only those who
      have been "born<br /> "again" can understand. You must remember that<br />
      "the carnal mind is enmity with God."<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is it
      not strange that Christ, in his Ser-<br /> mon on the Mount, did not speak
      of "regeneration,"<br /> or of the "scheme of salvation"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Well, it may be.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Can a man be saved now by
      living<br /> exactly in accordance with the Sermon on the Mount?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. He can not.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Would then a man,
      by following the<br /> course of conduct prescribed by Christ in the Sermon<br />
      on the Mount, lose his soul?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He most certainly
      would, because there<br /> is not one word in the Sermon on the Mount about<br />
      believing on the Lord Jesus Christ; not one word<br /> <br /> 428<br /> <br />
      about believing in the Bible; not one word about the<br /> "atonement;" not
      one word about "regeneration."<br /> So that, if the Presbyterian Church is
      right, it is abso-<br /> lutely certain that a man might follow the
      teachings<br /> of the Sermon on the Mount, and live in accordance<br />
      with its every word, and yet deserve and receive the<br /> eternal
      condemnation of God. But we must remem-<br /> ber that the Sermon on the
      Mount was preached be-<br /> fore Christianity existed. Christ was talking
      to Jews.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did Christ write anything himself, in<br />
      the New Testament?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Not a word.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Did he tell any of his disciples to write<br /> any of his words?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. There is no account of it, if he did.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do we know whether any of the dis-<br /> ciples wrote anything?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. Of course they did.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How do you
      know?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Because the gospels bear their names.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Are you satisfied that Christ was abso-<br /> lutely
      God?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course he was. We believe that<br />
      Christ and God and the Holy Ghost are all the same,<br /> that the three
      form one, and that each one is three.<br /> <br /> 429<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Was Christ the God of the universe at<br /> the time of his birth?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. He certainly was.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Was he
      the infinite God, creator<br /> and controller of the entire universe,
      before he was<br /> born?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course he was. This
      is the mystery<br /> of "God manifest in the flesh." The infidels have<br />
      pretended that he was like any other child, and was<br /> in fact supported
      by Nature instead of being the<br /> supporter of Nature. They have
      insisted that like<br /> other children, he had to be cared for by his
      mother.<br /> Of course he appeared to be cared for by his mother.<br /> It
      was a part of the plan that in all respects he should<br /> appear to be
      like other children.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did he know just as much
      before he<br /> was born as after?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. If he was God
      of course he did.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How do you account for the
      fact that<br /> Saint Luke tells us, in the last verse of the second<br />
      chapter of his gospel, that "Jesus increased in wis-<br /> "dom and
      stature"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. That I presume is a figure of speech;<br />
      because, if he was God, he certainly could not have<br /> increased in
      wisdom. The physical part of him could<br /> <br /> 430<br /> <br /> increase
      in stature, but the intellectual part must have<br /> been infinite all the
      time.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you think that Luke was mistaken?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No; I believe what Luke said. If it<br /> appears
      untrue, or impossible, then I know that it is<br /> figurative or
      symbolical.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did I understand you to say that
      Christ<br /> was actually God?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course he was.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Then why did Luke say in the same<br /> verse of the
      same chapter that "Jesus increased in<br /> "favor with God"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      I dare you to go into a room by your-<br /> self and read the fourteenth
      chapter of Saint John!<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is it necessary to
      understand the Bible<br /> in order to be saved?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Certainly not; it is only necessary that<br /> you believe it.<br /> <br />
      <i>Question</i>. Is it necessary to believe all the<br /> miracles?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. It may not be necessary, but as it is im-<br />
      possible to tell which ones can safely be left out, you<br /> had better
      believe them all.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Then you regard belief as
      the safe<br /> way?<br /> <br /> 431<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course it
      is better to be fooled in this<br /> world than to be damned in the next.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you think that there are any cruel-<br /> ties on
      God's part recorded in the Bible?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. At first
      flush, many things done by God<br /> himself, as well as by his prophets,
      appear to be<br /> cruel; but if we examine them closely, we will find<br />
      them to be exactly the opposite.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How do you
      explain the story of Elisha<br /> and the children,&mdash;where the two
      she-bears destroyed<br /> forty-two children on account of their impudence?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. This miracle, in my judgment, estab-<br /> lishes two
      things: 1. That children should be polite<br /> to ministers, and 2. That
      God is kind to animals&mdash;<br /> "giving them their meat in due season."
      These<br /> bears have been great educators&mdash;they are the<br />
      foundation of the respect entertained by the young<br /> for theologians.
      No child ever sees a minister now<br /> without thinking of a bear.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. What do you think of the story of<br /> Daniel&mdash;you
      no doubt remember it? Some men<br /> told the king that Daniel was praying
      contrary to<br /> law, and thereupon Daniel was cast into a den of<br />
      lions; but the lions could not touch him, their<br /> mouths having been
      shut by angels. The next<br /> <br /> 432<br /> <br /> morning, the king,
      finding that Daniel was still<br /> intact, had him taken out; and then,
      for the purpose<br /> of gratifying Daniels God, the king had all the men<br />
      who had made the complaint against Daniel, and<br /> their wives and their
      little children, brought and cast<br /> into the lions' den. According to
      the account, the<br /> lions were so hungry that they caught these wives<br />
      and children as they dropped, and broke all their<br /> bones in pieces
      before they had even touched the<br /> ground. Is it not wonderful that God
      failed to pro-<br /> tect these innocent wives and children?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      These wives and children were heathen;<br /> they were totally depraved.
      And besides, they were<br /> used as witnesses. The fact that they were
      devoured<br /> with such quickness shows that the lions were<br /> hungry.
      Had it not been for this, infidels would<br /> have accounted for the
      safety of Daniel by saying<br /> that the lions had been fed.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do you believe that Shadrach, Meshach<br /> and Abednego were cast "into a
      burning fiery furnace<br /> "heated one seven times hotter than it was wont
      to<br /> "be heated," and that they had on "their coats, their<br /> "hosen
      and their hats," and that when they came<br /> out "not a hair of their
      heads was singed, nor was<br /> "the smell of fire upon their garments"?<br />
      <br /> 433<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The evidence of this miracle is
      exceed-<br /> ingly satisfactory. It resulted in the conversion of<br />
      Nebuchadnezzar.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How do you know he was
      converted?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Because immediately after the miracle<br />
      the king issued a decree that "every people, nation<br /> "and language
      that spoke anything amiss against<br /> "the God of Shadrach and Company,
      should be cut<br /> "in pieces." This decree shows that he had become<br />
      a true disciple and worshiper of Jehovah.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If
      God in those days preserved from<br /> the fury of the fire men who were
      true to him and<br /> would not deny his name, why is it that he has failed<br />
      to protect thousands of martyrs since that time?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      This is one of the divine mysteries.<br /> God has in many instances
      allowed his enemies to<br /> kill his friends. I suppose this was allowed
      for the<br /> good of his enemies, that the heroism of the mar-<br /> tyrs
      might convert them.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you believe all the
      miracles?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I believe them all, because I believe
      the<br /> Bible to be inspired.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What makes you
      think it is inspired?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I have never seen anybody
      who knew<br /> it was not; besides, my father and mother believed it.<br />
      <br /> 434<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Have you any other reasons for be-<br />
      lieving it to be inspired?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes; there are more
      copies of the Bible<br /> printed than of any other book; and it is printed
      in<br /> more languages. And besides, it would be impossible<br /> to get
      along without it.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why could we not get along
      without it?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. We would have nothing to swear wit-<br />
      nesses by; no book in which to keep the family<br /> record; nothing for
      the centre-table, and nothing for<br /> a mother to give her son. No nation
      can be civilized<br /> without the Bible.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Did
      God always know that a Bible was<br /> necessary to civilize a country?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly he did.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why did
      he not give a Bible to<br /> the Egyptians, the Hindus, the Greeks and the<br />
      Romans?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. It is astonishing what perfect fools in-<br />
      fidels are.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why do you call infidels "fools"?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Because I find in the fifth chapter of the<br />
      gospel according to Matthew the following: "Who-<br /> "soever shall say
      'Thou fool!' shall be in danger of<br /> "hell fire."<br /> <br /> 435<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Have I the right to read the Bible?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Yes. You not only have the right, but<br /> it is your duty.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      In reading the Bible the words make<br /> certain impressions on my mind.
      These impressions<br /> depend upon my brain,&mdash;upon my intelligence.
      Is<br /> not this true?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course, when you read
      the Bible, im-<br /> pressions are made upon your mind.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Can I control these impressions?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I do not think
      you can, as long as you<br /> remain in a sinful state.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      How am I to get out of this sinful state?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. You
      must believe on the Lord Jesus<br /> Christ, and you must read the Bible in
      a prayerful<br /> spirit and with a believing heart.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Suppose that doubts force themselves<br /> upon my mind?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Then you will know that you are a sin-<br /> ner, and that you are
      depraved.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If I have the right to read the
      Bible,<br /> have I the right to try to understand it?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Most assuredly.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you admit that I have the
      right to<br /> reason about it and to investigate it?<br /> <br /> 436<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes; I admit that. Of course you can-<br /> not help
      reasoning about what you read.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Does the right
      to read a book include<br /> the right to give your opinion as to the truth
      of what<br /> the book contains?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course,&mdash;if
      the book is not inspired.<br /> Infidels hate the Bible because it is
      inspired, and<br /> Christians know that it is inspired because infidels<br />
      say that it is not.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Have I the right to decide
      for myself<br /> whether or not the book is inspired?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      You have no right to deny the truth of<br /> God's Holy Word.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Is God the author of all books?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly not.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Have I the right to say that God did<br /> not write
      the Koran?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Because the Koran was written by an<br /> impostor.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. How do you know?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. My
      reason tells me so.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Have you the right to be
      guided by<br /> your reason?<br /> <br /> 437<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I
      must be.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Have you the same right to follow
      your<br /> reason after reading the Bible?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No.
      The Bible is the standard of reason.<br /> The Bible is not to be judged or
      corrected by your<br /> reason. Your reason is to be weighed and measured<br />
      by the Bible. The Bible is different from other<br /> books and must not be
      read in the same critical spirit,<br /> nor judged by the same standard.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. What did God give us reason for?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      So that we might investigate other<br /> religions, and examine other
      so-called sacred books.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. If a man honestly
      thinks that the Bible<br /> is not inspired, what should he say?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. He should admit that he is mistaken.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      When he thinks he is right?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes. The Bible is
      different from other<br /> books. It is the master of reason. You read the<br />
      Bible, not to see if that is wrong, but to see<br /> whether your reason is
      right. It is the only book<br /> about which a man has no right to reason.
      He must<br /> believe. The Bible is addressed, not to the reason,<br /> but
      to the ears: "He that hath ears to hear, let<br /> "him hear."<br /> <br />
      <i>Question</i>. Do you think we have the right to tell<br /> <br /> 438<br />
      <br /> what the Bible means&mdash;what ideas God intended to<br /> convey,
      or has conveyed to us, through the medium<br /> of the Bible?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Well, I suppose you have that right.<br /> Yes, that must be your duty. You
      certainly ought<br /> to tell others what God has said to you.<br /> <br />
      <i>Question</i>. Do all men get the same ideas from<br /> the Bible?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How do you account
      for that?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Because all men are not alike; they<br />
      differ in intellect, in education, and in experience.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Who has the right to decide as to the<br /> real ideas that God intended to
      convey?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I am a Protestant, and believe in the<br />
      right of private judgment. Whoever does not is a<br /> Catholic. Each man
      must be his own judge, but God<br /> will hold him responsible.<br /> <br />
      <i>Question</i>. Does God believe in the right of private<br /> judgment?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Of course he does.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Is he
      willing that I should exercise my<br /> judgment in deciding whether the
      Bible is inspired or<br /> not?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. No. He believes
      in the exercise of<br /> <br /> 439<br /> <br /> private judgment only in the
      examination and rejec-<br /> tion of other books than the Bible.<br /> <br />
      <i>Question</i>. Is he a Catholic?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. I cannot
      answer blasphemy! Let me<br /> tell you that God will "laugh at your
      calamity, and<br /> "will mock when your fear cometh." You will be<br />
      accursed.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Why do you curse infidels?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Because I am a Christian.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Did not Christ say that we ought to<br /> "bless those who curse us," and
      that we should<br /> "love our enemies"?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes, but
      he cursed the Pharisees and<br /> called them "hypocrites" and "vipers."<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. How do you account for that?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      It simply shows the difference between<br /> theory and practice.<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. What do you consider the best way to<br /> answer
      infidels.<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The old way is the best. You should<br />
      say that their arguments are ancient, and have been<br /> answered over and
      over again. If this does not<br /> satisfy your hearers, then you should
      attack the<br /> character of the infidel&mdash;then that of his parents&mdash;<br />
      then that of his children.<br /> <br /> 440<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Suppose that the infidel is a good man,<br /> how will you answer him then?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. But an infidel cannot be a good man.<br /> Even if he
      is, it is better that he should lose his<br /> reputation, than that
      thousands should lose their<br /> souls. We know that all infidels are vile
      and infa-<br /> mous. We may not have the evidence, but we know<br /> that
      it exists.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. How should infidels be treated?
      Should<br /> Christians try to convert them?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      Christians should have nothing to do<br /> with infidels. It is not safe
      even to converse with<br /> them. They are always talking about reason, and<br />
      facts, and experience. They are filled with sophistry<br /> and should be
      avoided.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Should Christians pray for the con-<br />
      version of infidels?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Yes; but such prayers
      should be made<br /> in public and the name of the infidel should be given<br />
      and his vile and hideous heart portrayed so that the<br /> young may be
      warned.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. Whom do you regard as infidels?<br />
      <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The scientists&mdash;the geologists, the as-<br />
      tronomers, the naturalists, the philosophers. No one<br /> can overestimate
      the evil that has been wrought<br /> <br /> 441<br /> <br /> by Laplace,
      Humboldt, Darwin, Huxley, Haeckel,<br /> Renan, Emerson, Strauss, Bikhner,
      Tyndall, and<br /> their wretched followers. These men pretended to<br />
      know more than Moses and the prophets. They<br /> were "dogs baying at the
      moon." They were<br /> "wolves" and "fools." They tried to "assassinate<br />
      "God," and worse than all, they actually laughed<br /> at the clergy,<br />
      <br /> <i>Question</i>. Do you think they did, and are doing<br /> great
      harm?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Certainly. Of what use are all the<br />
      sciences, if you lose your own soul? People in hell<br /> will care nothing
      about education. The rich man<br /> said nothing about science, he wanted
      water.<br /> Neither will they care about books and theories<br /> in
      heaven. If a man is perfectly happy, it makes<br /> no difference how
      ignorant he is.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. But how can he answer these
      scientists?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. Well, my advice is to let their
      argu-<br /> ments alone. Of course, you will deny all their<br /> facts; but
      the most effective way is to attack their<br /> character.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      But suppose they are good men,&mdash;<br /> what then?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      The better they are, the worse they are.<br /> <br /> 442<br /> <br /> We
      cannot admit that the infidel is really good. He<br /> may appear to be
      good, and it is our duty to strip<br /> the mask of appearance from the
      face of unbelief. If<br /> a man is not a Christian, he is totally
      depraved, and<br /> why should we hesitate to make a misstatement<br />
      about a man whom God is going to make miserable<br /> forever?<br /> <br />
      <i>Question</i>. Are we not commanded to love our<br /> enemies?<br /> <br />
      <i>Answer</i>. Yes, but not the enemies of God.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      Do you fear the final triumph of infi-<br /> delity?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      No. We have no fear. We believe<br /> that the Bible can be revised often
      enough to agree<br /> with anything that may really be necessary to the<br />
      preservation of the church. We can always rely<br /> upon revision. Let me
      tell you that the Bible is the<br /> most peculiar of books. At the time
      God inspired his<br /> holy prophets to write it, he knew exactly what the<br />
      discoveries and demonstrations of the future would<br /> be, and he wrote
      his Bible in such a way that the<br /> words could always be interpreted in
      accordance with<br /> the intelligence of each age, and so that the words<br />
      used are capable of several meanings, so that, no<br /> matter what may
      hereafter be discovered, the Bible<br /> <br /> 443<br /> <br /> will be found
      to agree with it,&mdash;for the reason that<br /> the knowledge of Hebrew
      will grow in the exact<br /> proportion that discoveries are made in other
      depart-<br /> ments of knowledge. You will therefore see, that all<br />
      efforts of infidelity to destroy the Bible will simply<br /> result in
      giving a better translation.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What do you
      consider is the strongest<br /> argument in favor of the inspiration of the
      Scrip-<br /> tures?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The dying words of
      Christians.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>. What do you consider the strongest<br />
      argument against the truth of infidelity?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>. The
      dying words of infidels. You know<br /> how terrible were the death-bed
      scenes of Hume,<br /> Voltaire, Paine and Hobbes, as described by hundreds<br />
      of persons who were not present; while all Christians<br /> have died with
      the utmost serenity, and with their<br /> last words have testified to the
      sustaining power of<br /> faith in the goodness of God.<br /> <br /> <i>Question</i>.
      What were the last words of Jesus<br /> Christ?<br /> <br /> <i>Answer</i>.
      "My God, my God, why hast thou for-<br /> "saken me?"<br /> <br /> <br />
      <br /> <a name="link0010" id="link0010"></a><br /> <br /> <big><b>A
      VINDICATION OF THOMAS PAINE.</b></big><br /> <br /> <br /> <i>"To argue with
      a man who has renounced the use and<br /> authority of reason, is like
      administering<br /> medicine to the dead."&mdash;Thomas Paine.</i><br />
      <br /> <br /> Peoria, October 8, 1877.<br /> <br /> To the Editor of the N Y.
      Observer:<br /> <br /> Sir: Last June in San Francisco, I offered a<br />
      thousand dollars in gold&mdash;not as a wager, but as a<br /> gift&mdash;to
      any one who would substantiate the absurd<br /> story that Thomas Paine
      died in agony and fear,<br /> frightened by the clanking chains of devils.
      I also<br /> offered the same amount to any minister who would<br /> prove
      that Voltaire did not pass away as serenely as<br /> the coming of the
      dawn. Afterward I was informed<br /> that you had accepted the offer, and
      had called upon<br /> me to deposit the money. Acting upon this inform-<br />
      ation, I sent you the following letter:<br /> <br /> Peoria, Ill., August
      31st, 1877.<br /> <br /> To the Editor of the New York Observer:<br /> <br />
      I have been informed that you accepted, in your<br /> paper, an offer made
      by me to any clergyman in<br /> San Francisco. That offer was, that I would
      pay<br /> <br /> 448<br /> <br /> one thousand dollars in gold to any minister
      in that<br /> city who would prove that Thomas Paine died in<br /> terror
      because of religious opinions he had ex-<br /> pressed, or that Voltaire
      did not pass away serenely<br /> as the coming of the dawn.<br /> <br /> For
      many years religious journals and ministers<br /> have been circulating
      certain pretended accounts of<br /> the frightful agonies endured by Paine
      and Voltaire<br /> when dying; that these great men at the moment of<br />
      death were terrified because they had given their<br /> honest opinions
      upon the subject of religion to their<br /> fellow-men. The imagination of
      the religious world<br /> has been taxed to the utmost in inventing absurd<br />
      and infamous accounts of the last moments of these<br /> intellectual
      giants. Every Sunday school paper,<br /> thousands of idiotic tracts, and
      countless stupidities<br /> called sermons, have been filled with these
      calumnies.<br /> <br /> Paine and Voltaire both believed in God&mdash;both<br />
      hoped for immortality&mdash;both believed in special<br /> providence. But
      both denied the inspiration of the<br /> Scriptures&mdash;both denied the
      divinity of Jesus Christ.<br /> While theologians most cheerfully admit
      that most<br /> murderers die without fear, they deny the possibility<br />
      of any man who has expressed his disbelief in the<br /> inspiration of the
      Bible dying except in an agony of<br /> terror. These stories are used in
      revivals and in<br /> <br /> 449<br /> <br /> Sunday schools, and have long
      been considered of<br /> great value.<br /> <br /> I am anxious that these
      slanders shall cease. I<br /> am desirous of seeing justice done, even at
      this late<br /> day, to the dead.<br /> <br /> For the purpose of
      ascertaining the evidence upon<br /> which these death-bed accounts really
      rest, I make<br /> to you the following proposition:&mdash;<br /> <br />
      First.&mdash;As to Thomas Paine: I will deposit with<br /> the First
      National Bank of Peoria, Illinois, one thou-<br /> sand dollars in gold,
      upon the following conditions:<br /> This money shall be subject to your
      order when<br /> you shall, in the manner hereinafter provided, sub-<br />
      stantiate that Thomas Paine admitted the Bible to be<br /> an inspired
      book, or that he recanted his Infidel<br /> opinions&mdash;or that he died
      regretting that he had dis-<br /> believed the Bible&mdash;or that he died
      calling upon<br /> Jesus Christ in any religious sense whatever.<br /> <br />
      In order that a tribunal may be created to try this<br /> question, you may
      select one man, I will select<br /> another, and the two thus chosen shall
      select a third,<br /> and any two of the three may decide the matter.<br />
      <br /> As there will be certain costs and expenditures on<br /> both sides,
      such costs and expenditures shall be paid<br /> by the defeated party.<br />
      <br /> In addition to the one thousand dollars in gold, I<br /> <br /> 450<br />
      <br /> will deposit a bond with good and sufficient security<br /> in the
      sum of two thousand dollars, conditioned for<br /> the payment of all costs
      in case I am defeated. I<br /> shall require of you a like bond.<br /> <br />
      From the date of accepting this offer you may<br /> have ninety days to
      collect and present your testi-<br /> mony, giving me notice of time and
      place of taking<br /> depositions. I shall have a like time to take evi-<br />
      dence upon my side, giving you like notice, and you<br /> shall then have
      thirty days to take further testimony<br /> in reply to what I may offer.
      The case shall then<br /> be argued before the persons chosen; and their<br />
      decisions shall be final as to us.<br /> <br /> If the arbitrator chosen by
      me shall die, I shall<br /> have the right to choose another. You shall
      have<br /> the same right. If the third one, chosen by our two,<br /> shall
      die, the two shall choose another; and all va-<br /> cancies, from whatever
      cause, shall be filled upon the<br /> same principle.<br /> <br /> The
      arbitrators shall sit when and where a major-<br /> ity shall determine,
      and shall have full power to pass<br /> upon all questions arising as to
      competency of<br /> evidence, and upon all subjects.<br /> <br /> <i>Second</i>.&mdash;As
      to Voltaire: I make the same prop-<br /> osition, if you will substantiate
      that Voltaire died<br /> expressing remorse or showing in any way that he<br />
      <br /> 451<br /> <br /> was in mental agony because he had attacked Catholi-<br />
      cism&mdash;or because he had denied the inspiration of the<br /> Bible&mdash;or
      because he had denied the divinity of Christ.<br /> <br /> I make these
      propositions because I want you<br /> to stop slandering the dead.<br />
      <br /> If the propositions do not suit you in any particu-<br /> lar, please
      state your objections, and I will modify<br /> them in any way consistent
      with the object in view.<br /> <br /> If Paine and Voltaire died filled with
      childish and<br /> silly fear, I want to know it, and I want the world to<br />
      know it. On the other hand, if the believers in<br /> superstition have
      made and circulated these cruel<br /> slanders concerning the mighty dead,
      I want the<br /> world to know that.<br /> <br /> As soon as you notify me of
      the acceptance of<br /> these propositions I will send you the certificate
      of<br /> the bank that the money has been deposited upon<br /> the foregoing
      conditions, together with copies of<br /> bonds for costs. Yours truly,<br />
      <br /> R. G. Ingersoll.<br /> <br /> In your paper of September 27, 1877, you
      acknowl-<br /> edge the receipt of the foregoing letter, and after<br />
      giving an outline of its contents, say: "As not one<br /> of the
      affirmations, in the form stated in this letter,<br /> was contained in the
      offer we made, we have no<br /> occasion to substantiate them. But we are
      prepared<br /> <br /> 452<br /> <br /> to produce the evidence of the truth of
      our own<br /> statement, and even to go further; to show not only<br /> that
      Tom Paine 'died a drunken, cowardly, and<br /> beastly death,' but that for
      many years previous, and<br /> up to that event he lived a drunken and
      beastly life."<br /> In order to refresh your memory as to what you<br />
      had published, I call your attention to the following,<br /> which appeared
      in the N. Y. Observer, July 19, 1877:<br /> "Put Down the Money.<br /> <br />
      "Col. Bob Ingersoll, in a speech full of ribaldry<br /> and blasphemy, made
      in San Francisco recently, said:<br /> "I will give $1,000 in gold coin to
      any clergyman<br /> who can substantiate that the death of Voltaire was<br />
      not as peaceful as the dawn; and of Tom Paine whom<br /> they assert died
      in fear and agony, frightened by the<br /> clanking chains of devils&mdash;in
      fact frightened to death<br /> by God. I will give $1,000 likewise to any
      one who<br /> can substantiate this 'absurd story'&mdash;a story without<br />
      a word of truth in it."<br /> <br /> "We have published the testimony, and
      the wit-<br /> nesses are on hand to prove that Tom Paine died a<br />
      drunken, cowardly and beastly death. Let the Colo-<br /> nel deposit the
      money with any honest man, and the<br /> absurd story, as he terms it,
      shall be shown to be an<br /> ower true tale. But he wont do it. His talk
      is Infi-<br /> del 'buncombe' and nothing more."<br /> <br /> 453<br /> <br />
      On the 31st of August I sent you my letter, and<br /> on the 27th of
      September you say in your paper:<br /> "As not one of the affirmations in
      the form stated<br /> in this letter was contained in the offer we made, we<br />
      have no occasion to substantiate them."<br /> <br /> What were the
      affirmations contained in the offer<br /> you made? I had offered a
      thousand dollars in gold<br /> to any one who would substantiate "the
      absurd story"<br /> that Thomas Paine died in fear and agony,frightened<br />
      by the clanking chains of devils&mdash;in fact, frightened to<br /> death
      by God.<br /> <br /> In response to this offer you said: "Let the Colo-<br />
      nel deposit the money with an honest man and the<br /> 'absurd story' as he
      terms it, shall be shown to be<br /> an 'ower true tale.' But he won't do
      it. His talk<br /> is infidel 'buncombe' and nothing more."<br /> <br /> Did
      you not offer to prove that Paine died in fear<br /> and agony, frightened
      by the clanking chains of<br /> devils? Did you not ask me to deposit the
      money<br /> that you might prove the "absurd story" to be an<br /> "ower
      true tale" and obtain the money? Did you<br /> not in your paper of the
      twenty-seventh of September<br /> in effect deny that you had offered to
      prove this<br /> "absurd story"? As soon as I offered to deposit<br /> the
      gold and give bonds besides to cover costs, did<br /> you not publish a
      falsehood?<br /> <br /> 454<br /> <br /> You have eaten your own words, and,
      for my<br /> part, I would rather have dined with Ezekiel than<br /> with
      you.<br /> <br /> You have not met the issue. You have know-<br /> ingly
      avoided it. The question was not as to the<br /> personal habits of Paine.
      The real question was<br /> and is, whether Paine was filled with fear and
      horror<br /> at the time of his death on account of his religious<br />
      opinions. That is the question. You avoid this.<br /> In effect, you
      abandon that charge and make others.<br /> <br /> To you belongs the honor
      of having made the<br /> most cruel and infamous charges against Thomas<br />
      Paine that have ever been made. Of what you<br /> have said you cannot
      prove the truth of one word.<br /> <br /> You say that Thomas Paine died a
      drunken,<br /> cowardly and beastly death.<br /> <br /> I pronounce this
      charge to be a cowardly and<br /> beastly falsehood.<br /> <br /> Have you
      any evidence that he was in a drunken<br /> condition when he died?<br />
      <br /> What did he say or do of a cowardly character<br /> just before, or
      at about the time of his death?<br /> <br /> In what way was his death
      cowardly? You must<br /> answer these questions, and give your proof, or
      all<br /> honest men will hold you in abhorrence. You have<br /> made these
      charges. The man against whom you<br /> <br /> Vindication of thomas paine.<br />
      <br /> 455<br /> <br /> make them is dead. He cannot answer you. I<br /> can.
      He cannot compel you to produce your testi-<br /> mony, or admit by your
      silence that you have<br /> cruelly slandered the defenceless dead. I can
      and I<br /> will. You say that his death was cowardly. In<br /> what
      respect? Was it cowardly in him to hold the<br /> Thirty-Nine Articles in
      contempt? Was it cowardly<br /> not to call on your Lord? Was it cowardly
      not to<br /> be afraid? You say that his death was beastly.<br /> Again I
      ask, in what respect? Was it beastly to<br /> submit to the inevitable with
      tranquillity? Was it<br /> beastly to look with composure upon the approach<br />
      of death? Was it beastly to die without a com-<br /> plaint, without a
      murmur&mdash;to pass from life without<br /> a fear?<br /> <br /> Did Thomas
      Paine Recant?<br /> <br /> Mr. Paine had prophesied that fanatics would<br />
      crawl and cringe around him during his last mo-<br /> ments. He believed
      that they would put a lie in<br /> the mouth of Death.<br /> <br /> When the
      shadow of the coming dissolution was<br /> upon him, two clergymen, Messrs.
      Milledollar and<br /> Cunningham, called to annoy the dying man. Mr.<br />
      Cunningham had the politeness to say, "You have<br /> now a full view of
      death you cannot live long, and<br /> whosoever does not believe in the
      Lord Jesus Christ<br /> <br /> 456<br /> <br /> will asuredly be damned." Mr.
      Paine replied, "Let<br /> me have none of your popish stuff. Get away with<br />
      you. Good morning."<br /> <br /> On another occasion a Methodist minister
      ob-<br /> truded himself when Willet Hicks was present.<br /> This minister
      declared to Mr. Paine "that unless he<br /> repented of his unbelief he
      would be damned."<br /> Paine, although at the door of death, rose in his
      bed<br /> and indignantly requested the clergyman to leave<br /> his room.
      On another occasion, two brothers by<br /> the name of Pigott, sought to
      convert him. He was<br /> displeased and requested their departure. After-<br />
      ward Thomas Nixon and Captain Daniel Pelton<br /> visited him for the
      express purpose of ascertaining<br /> whether he had, in any manner,
      changed his relig-<br /> ious opinions. They were assured by the dying<br />
      man that he still held the principles he had expressed<br /> in his
      writings.<br /> <br /> Afterward, these gentlemen hearing that William<br />
      Cobbett was about to write a life of Paine, sent him<br /> the following
      note:<br /> <br /> New York, April 24, 1818.<br /> <br /> "Sir: We have been
      informed that you have a de-<br /> sign to write a history of the life and
      writings of<br /> Thomas Paine. If you have been furnished with<br />
      materials in respect to his religious opinions, or<br /> <br /> 457<br />
      <br /> rather of his recantation of his former opinions before<br /> his
      death, all you have heard of his recanting is false.<br /> Being aware that
      such reports would be raised after<br /> his death by fanatics who infested
      his house at the<br /> time it was expected he would die, we, the subscrib-<br />
      ers, intimate acquaintances of Thomas Paine since<br /> the year 1776, went
      to his house. He was sitting<br /> up in a chair, and apparently in full
      vigor and use of<br /> all his mental faculties. We interrogated him upon<br />
      his religious opinions, and if he had changed his<br /> mind, or repented
      of anything he had said or wrote<br /> on that subject. He answered, "Not
      at all," and<br /> appeared rather offended at our supposition that any<br />
      change should take place in his mind. We took<br /> down in writing the
      questions put to him and his<br /> answers thereto before a number of
      persons then in<br /> his room, among whom were his doctor, Mrs.<br />
      Bonneville, etc. paper is mislaid and cannot<br /> be found at present, but
      the above is the substance<br /> which can be attested by many living
      witnesses."<br /> <br /> Thomas Nixon.<br /> <br /> Daniel Pelton.<br /> <br />
      Mr. Jarvis, the artist, saw Mr. Paine one or two<br /> days before his
      death. To Mr. Jarvis he expressed<br /> his belief in his written opinions
      upon the subject of<br /> religion. B. F. Haskin, an attorney of the city
      of<br /> <br /> 458<br /> <br /> New York, also visited him and inquired as to
      his<br /> religious opinions. Paine was then upon the thresh-<br /> old of
      death, but he did not tremble. He was not a<br /> coward. He expressed his
      firm and unshaken belief<br /> in the religious ideas he had given to the
      world.<br /> <br /> Dr. Manley was with him when he spoke his last<br />
      words. Dr. Manley asked the dying man if he did<br /> not wish to believe
      that Jesus was the Son of God,<br /> and the dying philosopher answered: "I
      have no<br /> wish to believe on that subject." Amasa Woodsworth<br /> <br />
      sat up with Thomas Paine the night before his<br /> death. In 1839 Gilbert
      Vale hearing that Mr.<br /> Woodsworth was living in or near Boston,
      visited<br /> him for the purpose of getting his statement. The<br />
      statement was published in the Beacon of June 5,<br /> 1839, while
      thousands who had been acquainted with<br /> Mr. Paine were living.<br />
      <br /> The following is the article referred to.<br /> <br /> "We have just
      returned from Boston. One ob-<br /> ject of our visit to that city, was to
      see a Mr. Amasa<br /> Woodsworth, an engineer, now retired in a hand-<br />
      some cottage and garden at East Cambridge, Boston.<br /> This gentleman
      owned the house occupied by Paine<br /> at his death&mdash;while he lived
      next door. As an act<br /> of kindness Mr. Woodsworth visited Mr. Paine
      every<br /> day for six weeks before his death. He frequently<br /> <br />
      459<br /> <br /> sat up with him, and did so on the last two nights of<br />
      his life. He was always there with Dr. Manley, the<br /> physician, and
      assisted in removing Mr. Paine while<br /> his bed was prepared. He was
      present when Dr.<br /> Manley asked Mr. Paine "if he wished to believe<br />
      that Jesus Christ was the Son of God," and he de-<br /> scribes Mr. Paine's
      answer as animated. He says<br /> that lying on his back he used some
      action and with<br /> much emphasis, replied, "I have no wish to believe<br />
      on that subject." He lived some time after this, but<br /> was not known to
      speak, for he died tranquilly. He<br /> accounts for the insinuating style
      of Dr. Manley's<br /> letter, by stating that that gentleman just after its<br />
      publication joined a church. He informs us that he<br /> has openly
      reproved the doctor for the falsity con-<br /> tained in the spirit of that
      letter, boldly declaring be-<br /> fore Dr. Manley, who is yet living, that
      nothing<br /> which he saw justified the insinuations. Mr. Woods-<br />
      worth assures us that he neither heard nor saw any-<br /> thing to justify
      the belief of any mental change in<br /> the opinions of Mr. Paine previous
      to his death; but<br /> that being very ill and in pain chiefly arising
      from<br /> the skin being removed in some parts by long lying,<br /> he was
      generally too uneasy to enjoy conversation<br /> on abstract subjects.
      This, then, is the best evidence<br /> that can be procured on this
      subject, and we publish<br /> <br /> 460<br /> <br /> it while the
      contravening parties are yet alive, and<br /> with the authority of Mr.
      Woodsworth.<br /> <br /> Gilbert Vale.<br /> <br /> A few weeks ago I received
      the following letter<br /> which confirms the statement of Mr. Vale:<br />
      <br /> Near Stockton, Cal., Green-<br /> wood Cottage, July 9, 1877.<br />
      <br /> Col. Ingersoll: In 1842 I talked with a gentle-<br /> man in Boston.
      I have forgotten his name; but he was<br /> then an engineer of the
      Charleston navy yard. I am<br /> thus particular so that you can find his
      name on the<br /> books. He told me that he nursed Thomas Paine<br /> in his
      last illness, and closed his eyes when dead. I<br /> asked him if he
      recanted and called upon God to<br /> save him. He replied, "No. He died as
      he had<br /> taught. He had a sore upon his side and when we<br /> turned
      him it was very painful and he would cry out<br /> 'O God!' or something
      like that." "But," said<br /> the narrator, "that was nothing, for he
      believed in a<br /> God." I told him that I had often heard it asserted<br />
      from the pulpit that Mr. Paine had recanted in his<br /> last moments. The
      gentleman said that it was not<br /> true, and he appeared to be an
      intelligent, truthful<br /> man. With respect, I remain, etc.<br /> <br />
      Philip Graves, M. D.<br /> <br /> 461<br /> <br /> The next witness is Willet
      Hicks, a Quaker<br /> preacher. He says that during the last illness of<br />
      Mr. Paine he visited him almost daily, and that<br /> Paine died firmly
      convinced of the truth of the relig-<br /> ious opinions he had given to
      his fellow-men. It<br /> was to this same Willet Hicks that Paine applied
      for<br /> permission to be buried in the cemetery of the<br /> Quakers.
      Permission was refused. This refusal<br /> settles the question of
      recantation. If he had re-<br /> canted, of course there could have been no
      objection<br /> to his body being buried by the side of the best<br />
      hypocrites on the earth.<br /> <br /> If Paine recanted why should he be
      denied "a<br /> little earth for charity"? Had he recanted, it<br /> would
      have been regarded as a vast and splendid<br /> triumph for the gospel. It
      would with much noise<br /> and pomp and ostentation have been heralded<br />
      about the world.<br /> <br /> I received the following letter to-day. The<br />
      writer is well know in this city, and is a man of<br /> high character:<br />
      <br /> Peoria, Oct. 8th, 1877.<br /> <br /> Robert G. Ingersoll, Esteemed
      Friend: My<br /> parents were Friends (Quakers). My father died<br /> when I
      was very young. The elderly and middle-<br /> aged Friends visited at my
      mother's house. We<br /> <br /> 462<br /> <br /> lived in the city of New
      York. Among the number<br /> I distinctly remember Elias Hicks, Willet
      Hicks,<br /> <br /> and a Mr.-Day, who was a bookseller in Pearl<br /> <br />
      street. There were many others, whose names I<br /> do not now remember.
      The subject of the recanta-<br /> tion by Thomas Paine of his views about
      the Bible<br /> in his last illness, or at any other time, was dis-<br />
      cussed by them in my presence at different times.<br /> I learned from them
      that some of them had attended<br /> upon Thomas Paine in his last sickness
      and minis-<br /> tered to his wants up to the time of his death.<br /> And
      upon the question of whether he did recant<br /> there was but one
      expression. They all said that<br /> he did not recant in any manner. I
      often heard<br /> them say they wished he had recanted. In fact,<br />
      according to them, the nearer he approached death<br /> the more positive
      he appeared to be in his con-<br /> victions.<br /> <br /> These
      conversations were from 1820 to 1822. I<br /> was at that time from ten to
      twelve years old, but<br /> these conversations impressed themselves upon
      me<br /> because many thoughtless people then blamed the<br /> Society of
      Friends for their kindness to that "arch<br /> Infidel," Thomas Paine..<br />
      <br /> Truly yours,<br /> <br /> A. C. Hankinson.<br /> <br /> 463<br /> <br /> A
      few days ago I received the following letter:<br /> Albany, New York, Sept.
      27, 1877.<br /> <br /> Dear Sir: It is over twenty years ago that pro-<br />
      fessionally I made the acquaintance of John Hogeboom,<br /> <br /> a Justice
      of the Peace of the county of<br /> Rensselaer, New York. He was then over
      seventy<br /> years of age and had the reputation of being a man<br /> of
      candor and integrity. He was a great admirer of<br /> Paine. He told me
      that he was personally ac-<br /> quainted with him, and used to see him
      frequently<br /> during the last years of his life in the city of New<br />
      York, where Hogeboom then resided. I asked him<br /> if there was any truth
      in the charge that Paine was<br /> in the habit of getting drunk. He said
      that it was<br /> utterly false; that he never heard of such a thing<br />
      during the life-time of Mr. Paine, and did not believe<br /> any one else
      did. I asked him about the recantation<br /> of his religious opinions on
      his death-bed, and the<br /> revolting death-bed scenes that the world had
      heard<br /> so much about. He said there was no truth in<br /> them, that he
      had received his information from<br /> persons who attended Paine in his
      last illness, "and<br /> that he passed peacefully away, as we may say, in<br />
      the sunshine of a great soul."...<br /> <br /> Yours truly,<br /> <br /> W. J.
      Hilton,<br /> <br /> 464<br /> <br /> The witnesses by whom I substantiate the
      fact<br /> that Thomas Paine did not recant, and that he died<br /> holding
      the religious opinions he had published, are:<br /> First&mdash;Thomas
      Nixon, Captain Daniel Pelton,<br /> B. F. Haskin. These gentlemen visited
      him during<br /> his last illness for the purpose of ascertaining whether<br />
      he had in any respect changed his views upon relig-<br /> ion. He told them
      that he had not.<br /> <br /> Second&mdash;James Cheetham. This man was the<br />
      most malicious enemy Mr. Paine had, and yet he<br /> admits that "Thomas
      Paine died placidly, and al-<br /> most without a struggle." (See Life of
      Thomas<br /> Paine, by James Cheetham).<br /> <br /> Third&mdash;The
      ministers, Milledollar and Cunning-<br /> ham. These gentlemen told Mr.
      Paine that if he<br /> died without believing in the Lord Jesus Christ he<br />
      would be damned, and Paine replied, "Let me have<br /> none of your popish
      stuff. Good morning." (See<br /> Sherwin's Life of Paine, p. 220).<br />
      <br /> Fourth&mdash;Mrs. Hedden. She told these same<br /> preachers when
      they attempted to obtrude them-<br /> selves upon Mr. Paine again, that the
      attempt to<br /> convert Mr. Paine was useless&mdash;"that if God did not<br />
      change his mind no human power could."<br /> <br /> Fifth&mdash;Andrew A.
      Dean. This man lived upon<br /> Paine's farm at New Rochelle, and
      corresponded<br /> <br /> 465<br /> <br /> with him upon religious subjects.
      (See Paine's<br /> Theological Works, p. 308.)<br /> <br /> Sixth&mdash;Mr.
      Jarvis, the artist with whom Paine<br /> lived. He gives an account of an
      old lady coming<br /> to Paine and telling him that God Almighty had<br />
      sent her to tell him that unless he repented and be-<br /> lieved in the
      blessed Savior, he would be damned.<br /> Paine replied that God would not
      send such a foolish<br /> old woman with such an impertinent message. (See<br />
      Clio Rickman's Life of Paine.)<br /> <br /> Seventh&mdash;Wm. Carver, with
      whom Paine boarded.<br /> Mr. Carver said again and again that Paine did
      not<br /> recant. He knew him well, and had every opportun-<br /> ity of
      knowing. (See Life of Paine by Gilbert Vale.)<br /> <br /> Eighth&mdash;Dr.
      Manley, who attended him in his last<br /> sickness, and to whom Paine
      spoke his last words.<br /> Dr. Manley asked him if he did not wish to
      believe in<br /> Jesus Christ, and he replied, "I have no wish to<br />
      believe on that subject."<br /> <br /> Ninth&mdash;Willet Hicks and Elias
      Hicks, who were<br /> with him frequently during his last sickness, and<br />
      both of whom tried to persuade him to recant. Ac-<br /> cording to their
      testimony, Mr. Paine died as he had<br /> lived&mdash;a believer in God,
      and a friend of man.<br /> Willet Hicks was offered money to say something<br />
      false against Thomas Paine. He was even offered<br /> <br /> 466<br /> <br />
      money to remain silent and allow others to slander<br /> the dead. Mr.
      Hicks, speaking of Thomas Paine,<br /> said: "He was a good man&mdash;an
      honest man."<br /> (Vale's Life of Paine.)<br /> <br /> Tenth&mdash;Amasa
      Woodsworth, who was with him<br /> every day for some six weeks immediately
      preceding<br /> his death, and sat up with him the last two nights of<br />
      his life. This man declares that Paine did not recant<br /> and that he
      died tranquilly. The evidence of Mr.<br /> Woodsworth is conclusive.<br />
      <br /> Eleventh&mdash;Thomas Paine himself. The will of<br /> Thomas Paine,
      written by himself, commences as<br /> follows:<br /> <br /> "The last will
      and testament of me, the subscriber,<br /> Thomas Paine, reposing
      confidence in my creator<br /> God, and in no other being, for I know of no
      other,<br /> nor believe in any other;" and closes in these words;<br /> "I
      have lived an honest and useful life to mankind;<br /> my time has been
      spent in doing good, and I die in<br /> perfect composure and resignation
      to the will of my<br /> creator God."<br /> <br /> Twelfth&mdash;If Thomas
      Paine recanted, why do you<br /> pursue him? If he recanted, he died
      substantially<br /> in your belief, for what reason then do you denounce<br />
      his death as cowardly? If upon his death-bed he<br /> renounced the
      opinions he had published, the busi-<br /> <br /> 467<br /> <br /> ness of
      defaming him should be done by Infidels, not<br /> by Christians.<br />
      <br /> I ask you if it is honest to throw away the testi-<br /> mony of his
      friends&mdash;the evidence of fair and honor-<br /> able men&mdash;and take
      the putrid words of avowed and<br /> malignant enemies?<br /> <br /> When
      Thomas Paine was dying, he was infested<br /> by fanatics&mdash;by the
      snaky spies of bigotry. In the<br /> shadows of death were the unclean
      birds of prey<br /> waiting to tear with beak and claw the corpse of him<br />
      who wrote the "Rights of Man." And there lurk-<br /> ing and crouching in
      the darkness were the jackals<br /> and hyenas of superstition ready to
      violate his grave.<br /> <br /> These birds of prey&mdash;these unclean
      beasts are the<br /> witnesses produced and relied upon by you.<br /> <br />
      One by one the instruments of torture have been<br /> wrenched from the
      cruel clutch of the church, until<br /> within the armory of orthodoxy
      there remains but<br /> one weapon&mdash;Slander.<br /> <br /> Against the
      witnesses that I have produced you<br /> can bring just two&mdash;Mary
      Roscoe and Mary Hins-<br /> dale. The first is referred to in the memoir of<br />
      Stephen Grellet. She had once been a servant in his<br /> house. Grellet
      tells what happened between this<br /> girl and Paine. According to this
      account Paine<br /> asked her if she had ever read any of his writings,<br />
      <br /> 468<br /> <br /> and on being told that she had read very little of<br />
      them, he inquired what she thought of them, adding<br /> that from such an
      one as she he expected a correct<br /> answer.<br /> <br /> Let us examine
      this falsehood. Why would Paine<br /> expect a correct answer about his
      writings from one<br /> who had read very little of them? Does not such a<br />
      statement devour itself? This young lady further<br /> said that the "Age
      of Reason" was put in her hands<br /> and that the more she read in it the
      more dark and<br /> distressed she felt, and that she threw the book into<br />
      the fire. Whereupon Mr. Paine remarked, "I wish<br /> all had done as you
      did, for if the devil ever had any<br /> agency in any work, he had it in
      my writing that book."<br /> <br /> The next is Mary Hinsdale. She was a
      servant<br /> in the family of Willet Hicks. She, like Mary Ros-<br /> coe,
      was sent to carry some delicacy to Mr. Paine.<br /> To this young lady
      Paine, according to her account,<br /> said precisely the same that he did
      to Mary Roscoe,<br /> and she said the same thing to Mr. Paine.<br /> <br />
      My own opinion is that Mary Roscoe and Mary<br /> Hinsdale are one and the
      same person, or the same<br /> story has been by mistake put in the mouth
      of both.<br /> <br /> It is not possible that the same conversation should<br />
      have taken place between Paine and Mary Roscoe,<br /> and between him and
      Mary Hinsdale.<br /> <br /> 469<br /> <br /> Mary Hinsdale lived with Willet
      Hicks and he<br /> pronounced her story a pious fraud and fabrication.<br />
      He said that Thomas Paine never said any such<br /> thing to Mary Hinsdale.
      (See Vale's Life of<br /> Paine.)<br /> <br /> Another thing about this
      witness. A woman by<br /> the name of Mary Lockwood, a Hicksite Quaker,<br />
      died. Mary Hinsdale met her brother about that<br /> time and told him that
      his sister had recanted, and<br /> wanted her to say so at her funeral.
      This turned<br /> out to be false.<br /> <br /> It has been claimed that Mary
      Hinsdale made her<br /> statement to Charles Collins. Long after the
      alleged<br /> occurrence Gilbert Vale, one of the biographers of<br />
      Paine, had a conversation with Collins concerning<br /> Mary Hinsdale. Vale
      asked him what he thought<br /> of her. He replied that some of the Friends
      be-<br /> lieved that she used opiates, and that they did not<br /> give
      credit to her statements. He also said that he<br /> believed what the
      Friends said, but thought that<br /> when a young woman, she might have
      told the<br /> truth.<br /> <br /> In 1818 William Cobbett came to New York.<br />
      He began collecting materials for a life of Thomas<br /> Paine. In this he
      became acquainted with Mary<br /> Hinsdale and Charles Collins. Mr. Cobbett
      gave a<br /> <br /> 470<br /> <br /> full account of what happened in a letter
      addressed<br /> to the Norwich Mercury in 1819. From this ac-<br /> count it
      seems that Charles Collins told Cobbett that<br /> Paine had recanted.
      Cobbett called for the testi-<br /> mony, and told Mr. Collins that he must
      give time,<br /> place, and the circumstances. He finally brought a<br />
      statement that he stated had been made by Mary<br /> Hinsdale. Armed with
      this document Cobbett, in<br /> October of that year, called upon the said
      Mary<br /> Hinsdale, at No. 10 Anthony street, New York, and<br /> showed
      her the statement. Upon being questioned<br /> by Mr. Cobbett she said,
      "That it was so long ago<br /> that she could not speak positively to any
      part of the<br /> matter&mdash;that she would not say that any part of the<br />
      paper was true&mdash;that she had never seen the paper<br /> &mdash;and
      that she had never given Charles Collins<br /> authority to say anything
      about the matter in her<br /> name." And so in the month of October, in the<br />
      year of grace 1818, in the mist and fog of forgetful-<br /> ness
      disappeared forever one Mary Hinsdale&mdash;the<br /> last and only witness
      against the intellectual honesty<br /> of Thomas Paine.<br /> <br /> <i>Did
      Thomas Paine live the life of a drunken beast,<br /> and did he die a
      drunken, cowardly and beastly death?</i><br /> <br /> Upon you rests the
      burden of substantiating these<br /> infamous charges.<br /> <br /> 471<br />
      <br /> You have, I suppose, produced the best evidence<br /> in your
      possession, and that evidence I will now pro-<br /> ceed to examine. Your
      first witness is Grant Thor-<br /> burn. He makes three charges against
      Thomas<br /> Paine, 1st. That his wife obtained a divorce from<br /> him in
      England for cruelty and neglect. 2d. That<br /> he was a defaulter and fled
      from England to Amer-<br /> ica. 3d. That he was a drunkard.<br /> <br />
      These three charges stand upon the same evidence<br /> &mdash;the word of
      Grant Thorburn. If they are not all<br /> true Mr. Thorburn stands
      impeached.<br /> <br /> The charge that Mrs. Paine obtained a divorce on<br />
      account of the cruelty and neglect of her husband is<br /> utterly false.
      There is no such record in the world,<br /> and never was. Paine and his
      wife separated by<br /> mutual consent. Each respected the other. They<br />
      remained friends. This charge is without any foun-<br /> dation in fact. I
      challenge the Christian world to<br /> produce the record of this decree of
      divorce. Accord-<br /> ing to Mr. Thorburn it was granted in England. In<br />
      that country public records are kept of all such de-<br /> crees. Have the
      kindness to produce this decree<br /> showing that it was given on account
      of cruelty or<br /> admit that Mr. Thorburn was mistaken.<br /> <br /> Thomas
      Paine was a just man. Although sepa-<br /> rated from his wife, he always
      spoke of her with<br /> <br /> 472<br /> <br /> tenderness and respect, and
      frequently sent her<br /> money without letting her know the source from<br />
      whence it came. Was this the conduct of a drunken<br /> beast?<br /> <br />
      The second charge, that Paine was a defaulter in<br /> England and fled to
      America, is equally false. He<br /> did not flee from England. He came to
      America,<br /> not as a fugitive, but as a free man. He came with<br /> a
      letter of introduction signed by another Infidel,<br /> Benjamin Franklin.
      He came as a soldier of Free-<br /> dom&mdash;an apostle of Liberty.<br />
      <br /> In this second charge there is not one word of truth.<br /> <br /> He
      held a small office in England. If he was a<br /> defaulter the records of
      that country will show that<br /> fact.<br /> <br /> Mr. Thorburn, unless the
      record can be produced<br /> to substantiate him, stands convicted of at
      least two<br /> mistakes.<br /> <br /> Now, as to the third: He says that in
      1802 Paine<br /> was an "old remnant of mortality, drunk, bloated<br /> and
      half asleep."<br /> <br /> Can any one believe this to be a true account of<br />
      the personal appearance of Mr. Paine in 1802? He<br /> had just returned
      from France. He had been wel-<br /> comed home by Thomas Jefferson, who had
      said that<br /> he was entitled to the hospitality of every American.<br />
      <br /> 473<br /> <br /> In 1802 Mr. Paine was honored with a public din-<br />
      ner in the city of New York. He was called upon<br /> and treated with
      kindness and respect by such men<br /> as DeWitt Clinton.<br /> <br /> In
      1806 Mr. Paine wrote a letter to Andrew A.<br /> Dean upon the subject of
      religion. Read that letter<br /> and then say that the writer of it was an
      "old rem-<br /> nant of mortality, drunk, bloated and half asleep."<br />
      Search the files of the New York Observer from the<br /> first issue to the
      last, and you will find nothing supe-<br /> rior to this letter.<br /> <br />
      In 1803 Mr. Paine wrote a letter of considerable<br /> length, and of great
      force, to his friend Samuel<br /> Adams. Such letters are not written by
      drunken<br /> beasts, nor by remnants of old mortality, nor by<br />
      drunkards. It was about the same time that he<br /> wrote his "Remarks on
      Robert Hall's Sermons."<br /> <br /> These "Remarks" were not written by a
      drunken<br /> beast, but by a clear-headed and thoughtful man.<br /> <br />
      In 1804 he published an essay on the invasion of<br /> England, and a
      treatise on gunboats, full of valuable<br /> maritime information:&mdash;in
      1805, a treatise on yellow<br /> fever, suggesting modes of prevention. In
      short, he<br /> was an industrious and thoughtful man. He sympa-<br />
      thized with the poor and oppressed of all lands. He<br /> looked upon
      monarchy as a species of physical<br /> <br /> 474<br /> <br /> slavery. He
      had the goodness to attack that form<br /> of government. He regarded the
      religion of his day<br /> as a kind of mental slavery. He had the courage
      to<br /> give his reasons for his opinion. His reasons filled<br /> the
      churches with hatred. Instead of answering his<br /> arguments they
      attacked him. Men who were not<br /> fit to blacken his shoes, blackened
      his character.<br /> <br /> There is too much religious cant in the
      statement<br /> of Mr. Thorburn. He exhibited too much anxiety<br /> to tell
      what Grant Thorburn said to Thomas Paine.<br /> He names Thomas Jefferson
      as one of the disreputa-<br /> ble men who welcomed Paine with open arms.
      The<br /> testimony of a man who regarded Thomas Jefferson<br /> as a
      disreputable person, as to the character of any-<br /> body, is utterly
      without value. In my judgment, the<br /> testimony of Mr. Thorburn should
      be thrown aside<br /> as wholly unworthy of belief.<br /> <br /> Your next
      witness is the Rev. J. D. Wickham, D.<br /> D., who tells what an elder in
      his church said. This<br /> elder said that Paine passed his last days on
      his farm<br /> at New Rochelle with a solitary female attendant.<br /> This
      is not true. He did not pass his last days at<br /> New Rochelle.
      Consequently this pious elder did<br /> not see him during his last days at
      that place. Upon<br /> this elder we prove an alibi. Mr. Paine passed his<br />
      last days in the city of New York, in a house upon<br /> <br /> 475<br />
      <br /> Columbia street. The story of the Rev. J. D. Wick-<br /> ham, D.D.,
      is simply false.<br /> <br /> The next competent false witness is the Rev.<br />
      Charles Hawley, D.D., who proceeds to state that<br /> the story of the
      Rev. J. D. Wickham, D.D., is cor-<br /> roborated by older citizens of New
      Rochelle. The<br /> names of these ancient residents are withheld. Ac-<br />
      cording to these unknown witnesses, the account<br /> given by the deceased
      elder was entirely correct.<br /> But as the particulars of Mr. Paine's
      conduct "were<br /> too loathsome to be described in print," we are left<br />
      entirely in the dark as to what he really did.<br /> <br /> While at New
      Rochelle Mr. Paine lived with Mr.<br /> Purdy&mdash;with Mr. Dean&mdash;with
      Captain Pelton, and<br /> with Mr. Staple. It is worthy of note that all of<br />
      these gentlemen give the lie direct to the statements<br /> of "older
      residents" and ancient citizens spoken of<br /> by the Rev. Charles Hawley,
      D.D., and leave him<br /> with his "loathsome particulars" existing only in
      his<br /> own mind.<br /> <br /> The next gentleman you bring upon the stand
      is<br /> W. H. Ladd, who quotes from the memoirs of<br /> Stephen Grellet.
      This gentleman also has the mis-<br /> fortune to be dead. According to his
      account, Mr.<br /> Paine made his recantation to a servant girl of his<br />
      by the name of Mary Roscoe. To this girl, accord-<br /> <br /> 476<br />
      <br /> ing to the account, Mr. Paine uttered the wish that<br /> all who
      read his book had burned it. I believe there<br /> is a mistake in the name
      of this girl. Her name was<br /> probably Mary Hinsdale, as it was once
      claimed that<br /> Paine made the same remark to her, but this point<br /> I
      shall notice hereafter. These are your witnesses,<br /> and the only ones
      you bring forward, to support<br /> your charge that Thomas Paine lived a
      drunken and<br /> beastly life and died a drunken, cowardly and beastly<br />
      death. All these calumnies are found in a life of<br /> Paine by a Mr.
      Cheetham, the convicted libeler<br /> already referred to. Mr. Cheetham was
      an enemy<br /> of the man whose life he pretended to write.<br /> <br /> In
      order to show you the estimation in which Mr.<br /> Cheetham was held by
      Mr. Paine, I will give you a<br /> copy of a letter that throws light upon
      this point:<br /> <br /> October 28, 1807.<br /> <br /> "Mr. Cheetham: Unless
      you make a public apol-<br /> ogy for the abuse and falsehood in your paper
      of<br /> Tuesday, October 27th, respecting me, I will prose-<br /> cute you
      for lying."<br /> <br /> Thomas Paine.<br /> <br /> In another letter,
      speaking of this same man, Mr.<br /> Paine says: "If an unprincipled bully
      cannot be re-<br /> formed, he can be punished." "Cheetham has been<br /> so
      long in the habit of giving false information, that<br /> truth is to him
      like a foreign language."<br /> <br /> 477<br /> <br /> Mr. Cheetham wrote the
      life of Paine to gratify<br /> his malice and to support religion. He was
      prose-<br /> cuted for libel&mdash;was convicted and fined.<br /> <br /> Yet
      the life of Paine written by this man is referred<br /> to by the Christian
      world as the highest authority.<br /> <br /> As to the personal habits of
      Mr. Paine, we have<br /> the testimony of William Carver, with whom he<br />
      lived; of Mr. Jarvis, the artist, with whom he lived;<br /> of Mr. Staple,
      with whom he lived; of Mr. Purdy,<br /> who was a tenant of Paine's; of Mr.
      Burger, with<br /> whom he was intimate; of Thomas Nixon and<br /> Captain
      Daniel Pelton, both of whom knew him<br /> well; of Amasa Woodsworth, who
      was with him<br /> when he died; of John Fellows, who boarded at the<br />
      same house; of James Wilburn, with whom he<br /> boarded; of B. F. Haskin,
      a lawyer, who was well<br /> acquainted with him and called upon him during
      his<br /> last illness; of Walter Morton, a friend; of Clio<br /> Rickman,
      who had known him for many years; of<br /> Willet and Elias Hicks, Quakers,
      who knew him in-<br /> timately and well; of Judge Herttell, H. Margary,<br />
      Elihu Palmer, and many others. All these testified<br /> to the fact that
      Mr. Paine was a temperate man. In<br /> those days nearly everybody used
      spirituous liquors.<br /> Paine was not an exception; but he did not drink
      to<br /> excess. Mr. Lovett, who kept the City Hotel where<br /> <br /> 478<br />
      <br /> Paine stopped, in a note to Caleb Bingham, declared<br /> that Paine
      drank less than any boarder he had.<br /> <br /> Against all this evidence
      you produce the story of<br /> Grant Thorburn&mdash;the story of the Rev.
      J. D. Wick-<br /> ham that an elder in his church told him that Paine<br />
      was a drunkard, corroborated by the Rev. Charles<br /> Hawley, and an
      extract from Lossing's history to<br /> the same effect. The evidence is
      overwhelmingly<br /> against you. Will you have the fairness to admit it?<br />
      Your witnesses are merely the repeaters of the false-<br /> hoods of James
      Cheetham, the convicted libeler.<br /> <br /> After all, drinking is not as
      bad as lying. An<br /> honest drunkard is better than a calumniator of the<br />
      dead. "A remnant of old mortality, drunk, bloated<br /> and half asleep" is
      better than a perfectly sober<br /> defender of human slavery.<br /> <br />
      To become drunk is a virtue compared with steal-<br /> ing a babe from the
      breast of its mother.<br /> <br /> Drunkenness is one of the beatitudes,
      compared<br /> with editing a religious paper devoted to the defence<br />
      of slavery upon the ground that it is a divine insti-<br /> tution.<br />
      <br /> Do you really think that Paine was a drunken<br /> beast when he
      wrote "Common Sense"&mdash;a pamphlet<br /> that aroused three millions of
      people, as people were<br /> never aroused by a pamphlet before? Was he a<br />
      <br /> 479<br /> <br /> drunken beast when he wrote the "Crisis"? Was<br /> it
      to a drunken beast that the following letter was<br /> addressed:<br />
      <br /> Rocky Hill, September 10, 1783.<br /> <br /> "I have learned since I
      have been at this place,<br /> that you are at Bordentown.&mdash;Whether
      for the sake<br /> of retirement or economy I know not. Be it for<br />
      either or both, or whatever it may, if you will come<br /> to this place
      and partake with me I shall be exceed-<br /> ingly happy to see you at it.
      Your presence may<br /> remind Congress of your past services to this
      country;<br /> and if it is in my power to impress them, command<br /> my
      best exertions with freedom, as they will be<br /> rendered cheerfully by
      one who entertains a lively<br /> sense of the importance of your works,
      and who with<br /> much pleasure subscribes himself,<br /> <br /> "Your
      Sincere Friend,<br /> <br /> "George Washington."<br /> <br /> Did any of your
      ancestors ever receive a letter<br /> like that?<br /> <br /> Do you think
      that Paine was a drunken beast<br /> when the following letter was received
      by him?<br /> <br /> "You express a wish in your letter to return to<br />
      America in a national ship; Mr. Dawson, who brings<br /> over the treaty,
      and who will present you with this<br /> letter, is charged with orders to
      the captain of the<br /> <br /> 480<br /> <br /> Maryland to receive and
      accommodate you back, if you<br /> can be ready to depart at such a short
      warning. You<br /> will in general find us returned to sentiments worthy<br />
      of former times; <i>in these it will be your glory to have<br /> steadily
      labored and with as much effect as any man<br /> living.</i> That you may
      live long to continue your<br /> useful labors, and reap the reward in the
      <i>thankfulness<br /> of nations</i>, is my sincere prayer. Accept the
      assur-<br /> ances of my high esteem and affectionate attachment."<br />
      <br /> Thomas Jefferson.<br /> <br /> Did any of your ancestors ever receive
      a letter<br /> like that?<br /> <br /> "It has been very generally propagated
      through<br /> the continent that I wrote the pamphlet 'Common<br /> Sense.'
      I could not have written anything in so<br /> manly and striking a style."&mdash;John
      Adams.<br /> <br /> "A few more such flaming arguments as were<br />
      exhibited at Falmouth and Norfolk, added to the<br /> sound doctrine and
      unanswerable reasoning con-<br /> tained in the pamphlet 'Common Sense,'
      will not<br /> leave numbers at a loss to decide on the propriety of<br /> a
      separation."&mdash;George Washington.<br /> <br /> "It is not necessary for
      me to tell you how<br /> much all your countrymen&mdash;I speak of the
      great<br /> mass of the people&mdash;are interested in your welfare.<br />
      <br /> 481<br /> <br /> They have not forgotten the history of their own<br />
      Revolution and the difficult scenes through which<br /> they passed; nor do
      they review its several stages<br /> without reviving in their bosoms a due
      sensibility of<br /> the merits of those who served them in that great<br />
      and arduous conflict. The crime of ingratitude has<br /> not yet stained,
      and I trust never will stain, our<br /> national character. You are
      considered by them as<br /> not only having rendered important services in
      our<br /> own Revolution, but as being on a more extensive<br /> scale the
      friend of human rights, and a distinguished<br /> and able defender of
      public liberty. To the welfare<br /> of Thomas Paine the Americans are not,
      nor can<br /> they be indifferent.".. James Monroe.<br /> <br /> Did any of
      your ancestors ever receive a letter<br /> like that?<br /> <br /> "No writer
      has exceeded Paine in ease and famil-<br /> iarity of style, in perspicuity
      of expression, happiness<br /> of elucidation, and in simple and unassuming
      lan-<br /> guage."'&mdash;Thomas Jefferson.<br /> <br /> Was ever a letter
      like that written about an editor<br /> of the <i>New York Observer?</i><br />
      <br /> Was it in consideration of the services of a<br /> drunken beast that
      the Legislature of Pennsylvania<br /> presented Thomas Paine with five
      hundred pounds<br /> sterling?<br /> <br /> 482<br /> <br /> Did the State of
      New York feel indebted to a<br /> drunken beast, and confer upon Thomas
      Paine an<br /> estate of several hundred acres?<br /> <br /> "I believe in
      the equality of man, and I believe<br /> that religious duties consist in
      doing justice, loving<br /> mercy, and endeavoring to make our
      fellow-creat-<br /> ures happy."<br /> <br /> "My own mind is my own church."<br />
      <br /> "It is necessary to the happiness of man that he<br /> be mentally
      faithful to himself."<br /> <br /> "Any system of religion that shocks the
      mind of<br /> a child cannot be a true system."<br /> <br /> "The Word of God
      is the creation which we<br /> behold."<br /> <br /> "The age of ignorance
      commenced with the<br /> Christian system."<br /> <br /> "It is with a pious
      fraud as with a bad action&mdash;it<br /> begets a calamitous necessity of
      going on."<br /> <br /> "To read the Bible without horror, we must undo<br />
      everything that is tender, sympathizing and benev-<br /> olent in the heart
      of man."<br /> <br /> "The man does not exist who can say I have per-<br />
      secuted him, or that I have in any case returned evil<br /> for evil."<br />
      <br /> "Of all tyrannies that afflict mankind, tyranny in<br /> religion is
      the worst."<br /> <br /> 483<br /> <br /> "My own opinion is, that those whose
      lives have<br /> been spent in doing good and endeavoring to make<br />
      their fellow-mortals happy, will be happy hereafter."<br /> "The belief in
      a cruel god makes a cruel man."<br /> "The intellectual part of religion is
      a private affair<br /> between every man and his Maker, and in which no<br />
      third party has any right to interfere. The practical<br /> part consists
      in our doing good to each other."<br /> <br /> "No man ought to make a
      living by religion. One<br /> person cannot act religion for another&mdash;every
      person<br /> must perform it for himself."<br /> <br /> "One good
      schoolmaster is of more use than a<br /> hundred priests."<br /> <br /> "Let
      us propagate morality unfettered by super-<br /> stition."<br /> <br /> "God
      is the power, or first cause, Nature is the<br /> law, and matter is the
      subject acted upon."<br /> <br /> "I believe in one God and no more, and I
      hope<br /> for happiness beyond this life."<br /> <br /> "The key of heaven
      is not in the keeping of any<br /> sect nor ought the road to it to be
      obstructed<br /> by any."<br /> <br /> "My religion, and the whole of it, is
      the fear and<br /> love of the Deity and universal philanthropy."<br />
      <br /> "I have yet, I believe, some years in store, for I<br /> have a good
      state of health and a happy mind. I<br /> <br /> 484<br /> <br /> take care of
      both, by nourishing the first with tem-<br /> perance and the latter with
      abundance."<br /> <br /> "He lives immured within the Bastile of a<br />
      word."<br /> <br /> How perfectly that sentence describes you! The<br />
      Bastile in which you are immured is the word<br /> "Calvinism."<br /> <br />
      "Man has no property in man."<br /> <br /> What a splendid motto that would
      have made for<br /> the <i>New York Observer</i> in the olden time!<br />
      <br /> "The world is my country; to do good, my<br /> religion."<br /> <br />
      I ask you again whether these splendid utterances<br /> came from the lips
      of a drunken beast?<br /> <br /> <br /> <i>Did Thomas Paine die in
      destitution and want?</i><br /> <br /> The charge has been made, over and
      over again,<br /> that Thomas Paine died in want and destitution&mdash;<br />
      that he was an abandoned pauper&mdash;an outcast with-<br /> out friends
      and without money. This charge is just<br /> as false as the rest.<br />
      <br /> Upon his return to this country in 1802, he was<br /> worth $30,000,
      according to his own statement made<br /> at that time in the following
      letter addressed to Clio<br /> Rickman:<br /> <br /> "My Dear Friend: Mr.
      Monroe, who is appointed<br /> minister extraordinary to France, takes
      charge of<br /> <br /> 485<br /> <br /> this, to be delivered to Mr. Este,
      banker in Paris, to<br /> be forwarded to you.<br /> <br /> "I arrived at
      Baltimore the 30th of October, and<br /> you can have no idea of the
      agitation which my<br /> arrival occasioned. From New Hampshire to<br />
      Georgia (an extent of 1,500 miles) every newspaper<br /> was filled with
      applause or abuse.<br /> <br /> "My property in this country has been taken
      care<br /> of by my friends, and is now worth six thousand<br /> pounds
      sterling; which put in the funds will bring<br /> me &pound;400 sterling a
      year.<br /> <br /> "Remember me in affection and friendship to your<br />
      wife and family, and in the circle of your friends."<br /> <br /> Thomas
      Paine.<br /> <br /> A man in those days worth thirty thousand dol-<br /> lars
      was not a pauper. That amount would bring an<br /> income of at least two
      thousand dollars per annum.<br /> Two thousand dollars then would be fully
      equal to<br /> five thousand dollars now.<br /> <br /> On the 12th of July,
      1809, the year in which he<br /> died, Mr. Paine made his will. From this
      instru-<br /> ment we learn that he was the owner of a valuable<br /> farm
      within twenty miles of New York. He also<br /> was the owner of thirty
      shares in the New York<br /> Phoenix Insurance Company, worth upwards of
      fif-<br /> teen hundred dollars. Besides this, some personal<br /> <br /> 486<br />
      <br /> property and ready money. By his will he gave to<br /> Walter Morton,
      and Thomas Addis Emmett, brother<br /> of Robert Emmett, two hundred
      dollars each, and<br /> one hundred to the widow of Elihu Palmer.<br />
      <br /> Is it possible that this will was made by a pauper<br /> &mdash;by a
      destitute outcast&mdash;by a man who suffered for<br /> the ordinary
      necessaries of life?<br /> <br /> But suppose, for the sake of the argument,
      that he<br /> was poor and that he died a beggar, does that tend<br /> to
      show that the Bible is an inspired book and that<br /> Calvin did not burn
      Servetus? Do you really regard<br /> poverty as a crime? If Paine had died
      a millionaire,<br /> would you have accepted his religious opinions? If<br />
      Paine had drank nothing but cold water would you<br /> have repudiated the
      five cardinal points of Calvin-<br /> ism? Does an argument depend for its
      force upon<br /> the pecuniary condition of the person making it?<br /> As a
      matter of fact, most reformers&mdash;most men and<br /> women of genius,
      have been acquainted with poverty.<br /> Beneath a covering of rags have
      been found some of<br /> the tenderest and bravest hearts.<br /> <br /> Owing
      to the attitude of the churches for the last<br /> fifteen hundred years,
      truth-telling has not been a<br /> very lucrative business. As a rule,
      hypocrisy has<br /> worn the robes, and honesty the rags. That day is<br />
      passing away. You cannot now answer the argu-<br /> <br /> 487<br /> <br />
      ments of a man by pointing at holes in his coat.<br /> Thomas Paine
      attacked the church when it was<br /> powerful&mdash;when it had what was
      called honors to<br /> bestow&mdash;when it was the keeper of the public
      con-<br /> science&mdash;when it was strong and cruel. The church<br />
      waited till he was dead then attacked his reputation<br /> and his clothes.<br />
      <br /> Once upon a time a donkey kicked a lion. The<br /> lion was dead.<br />
      <br /> Conclusion.<br /> <br /> From the persistence with which the orthodox<br />
      have charged for the last sixty-eight years that<br /> Thomas Paine
      recanted, and that when dying he<br /> was filled with remorse and fear;
      from the malignity<br /> of the attacks upon his personal character, I had
      con-<br /> cluded that there must be some evidence of some<br /> kind to
      support these charges. Even with my ideas<br /> of the average honor of
      believers in superstition&mdash;<br /> the disciples of fear&mdash;I did
      not quite believe that all<br /> these infamies rested solely upon poorly
      attested<br /> lies. I had charity enough to suppose that some-<br /> thing
      had been said or done by Thomas Paine capa-<br /> ble of being tortured
      into a foundation for these<br /> calumnies. And I was foolish enough to
      think that<br /> even you would be willing to fairly examine the pre-<br />
      tended evidence said to sustain these charges, and<br /> <br /> 488<br />
      <br /> give your honest conclusion to the world. I sup-<br /> posed that
      you, being acquainted with the history of<br /> your country, felt under a
      certain obligation to<br /> Thomas Paine for the splendid services rendered
      by<br /> him in the darkest days of the Revolution. It was<br /> only
      reasonable to suppose that you were aware that<br /> in the midnight of
      Valley Forge the "Crisis," by<br /> Thomas Paine, was the first star that
      glittered in the<br /> wide horizon of despair. I took it for granted that<br />
      you knew of the bold stand taken and the brave<br /> words spoken by Thomas
      Paine, in the French Con-<br /> vention, against the death of the king. I
      thought it<br /> probable that you, being an editor, had read the<br />
      "Rights of Man;" that you knew that Thomas<br /> Paine was a champion of
      human liberty; that he was<br /> one of the founders and fathers of this
      Republic; that<br /> he was one of the foremost men of his age; that he<br />
      had never written a word in favor of injustice; that<br /> he was a
      despiser of slavery; that he abhorred tyr-<br /> anny in all its forms;
      that he was in the widest and<br /> highest sense a friend of his race;
      that his head was<br /> as clear as his heart was good, and that he had the<br />
      courage to speak his honest thought. Under these<br /> circumstances I had
      hoped that you would for the<br /> moment forget your religious prejudices
      and submit<br /> to the enlightened judgment of the world the evi-<br />
      <br /> 489<br /> <br /> dence you had, or could obtain, affecting in any way<br />
      the character of so great and so generous a man. This<br /> you have
      refused to do. In my judgment, you have<br /> mistaken the temper of even
      your own readers. A<br /> large majority of the religious people of this
      country<br /> have, to a considerable extent, outgrown the preju-<br />
      dices of their fathers. They are willing to know the<br /> truth and the
      whole truth, about the life and death of<br /> Thomas Paine. They will not
      thank you for having<br /> presented them the moss-covered, the maimed and
      dis-<br /> torted traditions of ignorance, prejudice, and credulity.<br />
      By this course you will convince them not of the<br /> wickedness of Paine,
      but of your own unfairness.<br /> <br /> What crime had Thomas Paine
      committed that he<br /> should have feared to die? The only answer you<br />
      can give is, that he denied the inspiration of the<br /> Scriptures. If
      this is a crime, the civilized world is<br /> filled with criminals. The
      pioneers of human thought<br /> &mdash;the intellectual leaders of the
      world&mdash;the foremost<br /> men in every science&mdash;the kings of
      literature and<br /> art&mdash;those who stand in the front rank of
      investiga-<br /> tion&mdash;the men who are civilizing, elevating,
      instruct-<br /> ing, and refining mankind, are to-day unbelievers in<br />
      the dogma of inspiration. Upon this question, the<br /> intellect of
      Christendom agrees with the conclusions<br /> reached by the genius of
      Thomas Paine. Centuries<br /> <br /> 490<br /> <br /> ago a noise was made for
      the purpose of frightening<br /> mankind. Orthodoxy is the echo of that
      noise.<br /> <br /> The man who now regards the Old Testament as<br /> in any
      sense a sacred or inspired book is, in my judg-<br /> ment, an intellectual
      and moral deformity. There is<br /> in it so much that is cruel, ignorant,
      and ferocious<br /> that it is to me a matter of amazement that it was<br />
      ever thought to be the work of a most merciful deity.<br /> <br /> Upon the
      question of inspiration Thomas Paine<br /> gave his honest opinion. Can it
      be that to give an<br /> honest opinion causes one to die in terror and de-<br />
      spair? Have you in your writings been actuated by<br /> the fear of such a
      consequence? Why should it be<br /> taken for granted that Thomas Paine,
      who devoted<br /> his life to the sacred cause of freedom, should have<br />
      been hissed at in the hour of death by the snakes of<br /> conscience,
      while editors of Presbyterian papers who<br /> defended slavery as a divine
      institution, and cheer-<br /> fully justified the stealing of babes from
      the breasts of<br /> mothers, are supposed to have passed smilingly from<br />
      earth to the embraces of angels? Why should you<br /> think that the heroic
      author of the "Rights of Man"<br /> should shudderingly dread to leave this
      "bank and<br /> shoal of time," while Calvin, dripping with the blood<br />
      of Servetus, was anxious to be judged of God? Is<br /> it possible that the
      persecutors&mdash;the instigators of<br /> <br /> 491<br /> <br /> the
      massacre of St. Bartholomew&mdash;the inventors and<br /> users of
      thumb-screws, and iron boots, and racks&mdash;<br /> the burners and
      tearers of human flesh&mdash;the stealers,<br /> whippers and enslavers of
      men&mdash;the buyers and<br /> beaters of babes and mothers&mdash;the
      founders of<br /> inquisitions&mdash;the makers of chains, the builders of<br />
      dungeons, the slanderers of the living and the calum-<br /> niators of the
      dead, all died in the odor of sanctity,<br /> with white, forgiven hands
      folded upon the breasts<br /> of peace, while the destroyers of prejudice&mdash;the<br />
      apostles of humanity&mdash;the soldiers of liberty&mdash;the<br /> breakers
      of fetters&mdash;the creators of light&mdash;died sur-<br /> rounded with
      the fierce fiends of fear?<br /> <br /> In your attempt to destroy the
      character of Thomas<br /> Paine you have failed, and have succeeded only in<br />
      leaving a stain upon your own. You have written<br /> words as cruel,
      bitter and heartless as the creed of<br /> Calvin. Hereafter you will stand
      in the pillory of<br /> history as a defamer&mdash;a calumniator of the
      dead.<br /> You will be known as the man who said that Thomas<br /> Paine,
      the "Author Hero," lived a drunken, coward-<br /> ly and beastly life, and
      died a drunken and beastly<br /> death. These infamous words will be
      branded upon<br /> the forehead of your reputation. They will be re-<br />
      membered against you when all else you may have<br /> uttered shall have
      passed from the memory of men.<br /> <br /> Robert G. Ingersoll.<br /> <br />

      OBSERVER'S SECOND ATTACK</b></big><br /> <br /> <i>* From the NY. Observer
      of Nov. 1, 1877.</i><br /> <br /> <br /> TOM PAINE AGAIN.<br /> <br /> In the
      Observer of September 27th, in response<br /> to numerous calls from
      different parts of the country<br /> for information, and in fulfillment of
      a promise, we<br /> presented a mass of testimony, chiefly from persons<br />
      with whom we had been personally acquainted,<br /> establishing the truth
      of our assertions in regard to<br /> the dissolute life and miserable end
      of Paine. It was<br /> not a pleasing subject for discussion, and an
      apology,<br /> or at least an explanation, is due to our readers for<br />
      resuming it, and for occupying so much space, or<br /> any space, in
      exhibiting the truth and the proofs in<br /> regard to the character of a
      man who had become so<br /> debased by his intemperance, and so vile in his<br />
      habits, as to be excluded, for many years before and<br /> up to the time
      of his death, from all decent society.<br /> <br /> Our reasons for taking
      up the subject at all, and<br /> for presenting at this time so much
      additional testi-<br /> mony in regard to the facts of the case, are these:<br />
      At different periods for the last fifty years, efforts<br /> <br /> 493<br />
      <br /> have been made by Infidels to revive and honor the<br /> memory of
      one whose friends would honor him most<br /> by suffering his name to sink
      into oblivion, if that<br /> were possible. About two years since, Rev. O.
      B.<br /> Frothingham, of this city, came to their aid, and<br /> undertook a
      sort of championship of Paine, making<br /> in a public discourse this
      statement: "No private<br /> character has been more foully calumniated in
      the<br /> name of God than that of Thomas Paine." (Mr.<br /> Frothingham, it
      will be remembered, is the one who<br /> recently, in a public discourse,
      announced the down-<br /> fall of Christianity, although he very kindly
      made<br /> the allowance that, "it may be a thousand years<br /> before its
      decay will be visible to all eyes." It is<br /> our private opinion that it
      will be at least a thousand<br /> and one.) Rev. John W. Chadwick, a
      minister of<br /> the same order of unbelief, who signs himself, "Min-<br />
      ister of the Second Unitarian Society in Brooklyn,"<br /> has devoted two
      discourses to the same end, eulogiz-<br /> ing Paine. In one of these,
      which we have before<br /> us in a handsomely printed pamphlet, entitled,<br />
      "Method and Value of his (Paine's) Religious<br /> Teachings," he says:
      "Christian usage has determ-<br /> ined that an Infidel means one who does
      not believe<br /> in Christianity as a supernatural religion; in the<br />
      Bible as a Supernatural book; in Jesus as a super-<br /> <br /> 494<br />
      <br /> natural person. And in this sense Paine was an<br /> Infidel, and so,
      thank God, am I." It is proper to<br /> add that Unitarians generally
      decline all responsibil-<br /> ity for the utterances of both of these men,
      and that<br /> they compose a denomination, or rather two denom-<br />
      inations, of their own.<br /> <br /> There is also a certain class of
      Infidels who are<br /> not quite prepared to meet the odium that attaches<br />
      to the name; they call themselves Christians, but<br /> their sympathies
      are all with the enemies of Chris-<br /> tianity, and they are not always
      able to conceal it.<br /> They have not the courage of their opinions, like<br />
      Mr. Frothingham and Mr. Chadwick, and they work<br /> only sideways toward
      the same end. We have been<br /> no little amused since our last article on
      this subject<br /> appeared, to read some of the articles that have been<br />
      written on the other side, though professedly on no<br /> side, and to
      observe how sincerely these men depre-<br /> cate the discussion of the
      character of Paine, as an<br /> unprofitable topic. It never appeared to
      them un-<br /> profitable when the discussion was on the other side.<br />
      <br /> Then, too, we have for months past been receiving<br /> letters from
      different parts of the country, asking<br /> authentic information on the
      subject and stating that<br /> the followers of Paine are making
      extraordinary<br /> efforts to circulate his writings against the Christian<br />
      <br /> 495<br /> <br /> religion, and in order to give currency to these
      writ-<br /> ings they are endeavoring to rescue his name from<br /> the
      disgrace into which it sank during the latter<br /> years of his life.
      Paine spent several of his last<br /> years in furnishing a commentary upon
      his Infidel<br /> principles. This commentary was contained in his<br />
      besotted, degraded life and miserable end, but his<br /> friends do not
      wish the commentary to go out in<br /> connection with his writings. They
      prefer to have<br /> them read without the comments by their author.<br />
      Hence this anxiety to free the great apostle of<br /> Infidelity from the
      obloquy which his life brought<br /> upon his name; to represent him as a
      pure, noble,<br /> virtuous man, and to make it appear that he died a<br />
      peaceful, happy death, just like a philosopher.<br /> <br /> But what makes
      the publication of the facts in the<br /> case still more imperative at
      this time is the whole-<br /> sale accusation brought against the Christian
      public<br /> by the friends and admirers of Paine. Christian<br /> ministers
      as a class, and Christian journals are<br /> expressly accused of
      falsifying history, of defaming<br /> "the mighty dead!" (meaning Paine,)
      etc. In<br /> the face of all these accusations it cannot be out of<br />
      place to state the facts and to fortify the statement<br /> by satisfactory
      evidence, as we are abundantly able<br /> to do.<br /> <br /> 496<br /> <br />
      The two points on which we proposed to produce<br /> the testimony are, the
      character of Paine's life (refer-<br /> ring of course to his last
      residence in this country,<br /> for no one has intimated that he had sunk
      into such<br /> besotted drunkenness until about the time of his<br />
      return to the United States in 1802), and the real<br /> character of his
      death as consistent with such a life,<br /> and as marked further by the
      cowardliness, which<br /> has been often exhibited by Infidels in the same<br />
      circumstances.<br /> <br /> It is nothing at all to the purpose to show, as
      his<br /> friends are fond of doing, that Paine rendered<br /> important
      service to the cause of American Inde-<br /> pendence. This is not the
      point under discussion<br /> and is not denied. No one ever called in
      question<br /> the valuable service that Benedict Arnold rendered<br /> to
      the country in the early part of the Revolutionary<br /> war; but this,
      with true Americans, does not suffice<br /> to cast a shade of loveliness
      or even to spread a man-<br /> tle of charity over his subsequent career.
      Whatever<br /> share Paine had in the personal friendship of the<br />
      fathers of the Revolution he forfeited by his subse-<br /> quent life of
      beastly drunkenness and degradation,<br /> and on this account as well as
      on account of his<br /> blasphemy he was shunned by all decent people.<br />
      <br /> We wish to make one or two corrections of mis-<br /> <br /> 497<br />
      <br /> statements by Paine's advocates, on which a vast<br /> amount of
      argument has been simply wasted. We<br /> have never stated in any form,
      nor have we ever<br /> supposed, that Paine actually renounced his Infidel-<br />
      ity. The accounts agree in stating that he died a<br /> blaspheming
      Infidel, and his horrible death we regard<br /> as one of the fruits, the
      fitting complement of his<br /> Infidelity. We have never seen anything
      that<br /> encouraged the hope that he was not abandoned of<br /> God in his
      last hours. But we have no doubt, on<br /> the other hand, that having
      become a wreck in body<br /> and mind through his intemperance, abandoned
      of<br /> God, deserted by his Infidel companions, and de-<br /> pendent upon
      Christian charity for the attentions he<br /> received, miserable beyond
      description in his condi-<br /> tion, and seeing nothing to hope for in the
      future, he<br /> was afraid to die, and was ready to call upon God<br /> and
      upon Christ for mercy, and ready perhaps in the<br /> next minute to
      blaspheme. This is what we referred<br /> to in speaking of Paine's death
      as cowardly. It is<br /> shown in the testimony we have produced, and still<br />
      more fully in that which we now present. The most<br /> wicked men are
      ready to call upon God in seasons<br /> of great peril, and sometimes ask
      for Christian min-<br /> istrations when in extreme illness; but they are<br />
      often ready on any alleviation of distress to turn to<br /> <br /> 498<br />
      <br /> their wickedness again, in the expressive language<br /> of
      Scripture, "as the sow that was washed to her<br /> wallowing in the mire."<br />
      <br /> We have never stated or intimated, nor, so far as<br /> we are aware,
      has any one of our correspondents<br /> stated, that Paine died in poverty.
      It has been<br /> frequently and truthfully stated that Paine was de-<br />
      pendent on Christian charity for the attentions he<br /> received in his
      last days, and so he was. His Infidel<br /> companions forsook him and
      Christian hearts and<br /> hands ministered to his wants, notwithstanding
      the<br /> blasphemies of his death-bed.<br /> <br /> Nor has one of our
      correspondents stated, as<br /> alleged, that Paine died at New Rochelle.
      The<br /> Rev. Dr. Wickham, who was a resident of that place<br /> nearly
      fifty years ago, and who was perfectly familiar<br /> with the facts of his
      life, wrote that Paine spent "his<br /> latter days" on the farm presented
      to him by<br /> the State of New York, which was strictly true,<br /> but
      made no reference to it as the place of his<br /> death.<br /> <br /> Such
      misrepresentations serve to show how much<br /> the advocates of Paine
      admire "truth."<br /> <br /> With these explanations we produce further evi-<br />
      dence in regard to the manner of Paine's life and the<br /> character of
      his death, both of which we have already<br /> <br /> 499<br /> <br />
      characterized in appropriate terms, as the following<br /> testimony will
      show.<br /> <br /> In regard to Paine's "personal habits," even before<br />
      his return to this country, and particularly his aver-<br /> sion to soap
      and water, Elkana Watson, a gentleman<br /> of the highest social position,
      who resided in France<br /> during a part of the Revolutionary war, and who<br />
      was the personal friend of Washington, Franklin,<br /> and other patriots
      of the period, makes some inci-<br /> dental statements in his "Men and
      Times of the<br /> Revolution." Though eulogizing Paine's efforts in<br />
      behalf of American Independence, he describes him<br /> as "coarse and
      uncouth in his manners, loathsome<br /> in his appearance, and a disgusting
      egotist." On<br /> Paine's arrival at Nantes, the Mayor and other dis-<br />
      tinguished citizens called upon him to pay their<br /> respects to the
      American patriot. Mr. Watson says:<br /> "He was soon rid of his
      respectable visitors, who<br /> left the room with marks of astonishment
      and dis-<br /> gust." Mr. W., after much entreaty, and only by<br />
      promising him a bundle of newspapers to read while<br /> undergoing the
      operation, succeeded in prevailing<br /> on Paine to "stew, for an hour, in
      a hot bath." Mr.<br /> W. accompanied Paine to the bath, and "instructed<br />
      the keeper, in French, (which Paine did not under-<br /> stand,) gradually
      to increase the heat of the water<br /> <br /> 500<br /> <br /> until 'le
      Monsieur serait bien bouille (until the gentle-<br /> man shall be well
      boiled;) and adds that "he became<br /> so much absorbed in his reading
      that he was nearly-<br /> parboiled before leaving the bath, much to his
      im-<br /> provement and my satisfaction."<br /> <br /> William Carver has
      been cited as a witness in be-<br /> half of Paine, and particularly as to
      his "personal<br /> habits." In a letter to Paine, dated December 2,<br />
      1776, he bears the following testimony:<br /> <br /> "A respectable
      gentlemen from New Rochelle<br /> called to see me a few days back, and
      said that<br /> everybody was tired of you there, and no one would<br />
      undertake to board and lodge you. I thought this<br /> was the case, as I
      found you at a tavern in a most<br /> miserable situation. You appeared as
      if you had<br /> not been shaved for a fortnight, and as to a shirt, it<br />
      could not be said that you had one on. It was only<br /> the remains of
      one, and this, likewise, appeared not<br /> to have been off your back for
      a fortnight, and was<br /> nearly the color of tanned leather; and you had
      the<br /> most disagreeable smell possible; just like that of<br /> our poor
      beggars in England. Do you remember the<br /> pains I took to clean you?
      that I got a tub of warm<br /> water and soap and washed you from head to
      foot, and<br /> this I had to do three times before I could get you<br />
      clean." (And then follow more disgusting details.)<br /> <br /> 501<br />
      <br /> "You say, also, that you found your own liquors<br /> during the time
      you boarded with me; but you<br /> should have said, 'I found only a small
      part of the<br /> liquor I drank during my stay with you; this part I<br />
      purchased of John Fellows, which was a demijohn of<br /> brandy containing
      four gallons, and this did not serve<br /> me three weeks.' This can be
      proved, and I mean<br /> not to say anything that I cannot prove; for I
      hold<br /> truth as a precious jewel. It is a well-known fact,<br /> that
      you drank one quart of brandy per day, at my<br /> expense, during the
      different times that you have<br /> boarded with me, the demijohn above
      mentioned<br /> excepted, and the last fourteen weeks you were sick.<br />
      Is not this a supply of liquor for dinner and supper?"<br /> This chosen
      witness in behalf of Paine, closes his<br /> letter, which is full of
      loathsome descriptions of<br /> Paine's manner of life, as follows:<br />
      <br /> "Now, sir, I think I have drawn a complete por-<br /> trait of your
      character; yet to enter upon every<br /> minutiae would be to give a
      history of your life, and<br /> to develop the fallacious mask of hypocrisy
      and de-<br /> ception under which you have acted in your political<br /> as
      well as moral capacity of life."<br /> <br /> (Signed) "William Carver."<br />
      <br /> Carver had the same opinion of Paine to his dying<br /> day. When an
      old man, and an Infidel of the Paine<br /> <br /> 502<br /> <br /> type and
      habits, he was visited by the Rev. E. F.<br /> Hatfield, D.D., of this
      city, who writes to us of his<br /> interview with Carver, under date of
      Sept. 27, 1877:<br /> "I conversed with him nearly an hour. I took<br />
      special pains to learn from him all that I could about<br /> Paine, whose
      landlord he had been for eighteen<br /> months. He spoke of him as a base
      and shameless<br /> drunkard, utterly destitute of moral principle. His<br />
      denunciations of the man were perfectly fearful, and<br /> fully confirmed,
      in my apprehension, all that had been<br /> written of Paine's immorality
      and repulsiveness."<br /> Cheetham's Life of Paine, which was published<br />
      the year that he died, and which has passed through<br /> several editions
      (we have three of them now before<br /> us) describes a man lost to all
      moral sensibility and<br /> to all sense of decency, a habitual drunkard,
      and it is<br /> simply incredible that a book should have appeared<br /> so
      soon after the death of its subject and should have<br /> been so
      frequently republished without being at once<br /> refuted, if the
      testimony were not substantially true.<br /> Many years later, when it was
      found necessary to<br /> bolster up the reputation of Paine, Cheetham's<br />
      Memoirs were called a pack of lies. If only one-<br /> tenth part of what
      he publishes circumstantially in<br /> his volume, as facts in regard to
      Paine, were true, all<br /> that has been written against him in later
      years does<br /> <br /> 503<br /> <br /> not begin to set forth the degraded
      character of the<br /> man's life. And with all that has been written on<br />
      the subject we see no good reason to doubt the sub-<br /> stantial accuracy
      of Cheetham's portrait of the man<br /> whom he knew so well.<br /> <br />
      Dr. J. W. Francis, well-known as an eminent phy-<br /> sician, of this
      city, in his Reminiscences of New York,<br /> says of Paine:<br /> <br /> "He
      who, in his early days, had been associated<br /> with, and had received
      counsel from Franklin, was,<br /> in his old age, deserted by the humblest
      menial; he,<br /> whose pen has proved a very sword among nations,<br /> had
      shaken empires, and made kings tremble, now<br /> yielded up the mastery to
      the most treacherous of<br /> tyrants, King Alcohol."<br /> <br /> The
      physician who attended Paine during his last<br /> illness was Dr. James R.
      Manley, a gentleman of the<br /> highest character. A letter of his,
      written in Octo-<br /> ber of the year that Paine died, fully corroborates<br />
      the account of his state as recorded by Stephen<br /> Grellet in his
      Memoirs, which we have already<br /> printed. He writes:<br /> <br /> "New
      York, October 2, 1809: I was called upon<br /> by accident to visit Mr.
      Paine, on the 25th of Feb-<br /> ruary last, and found him indisposed with
      fever, and<br /> very apprehensive of an attack of apoplexy, as he<br />
      <br /> 504<br /> <br /> stated that he had that disease before, and at this<br />
      time felt a great degree of vertigo, and was unable<br /> to help himself
      as he had hitherto done, on account<br /> of an intense pain above the
      eyes. On inquiry of<br /> the attendants I was told that three or four days<br />
      previously he had concluded to dispense with his<br /> usual quantity of
      accustomed stimulus and that he<br /> had on that day resumed it. To the
      want of his<br /> usual drink they attributed his illness, and it is highly<br />
      probable that the usual quantity operating upon a<br /> state of system
      more excited from the above priva-<br /> tions, was the cause of the
      symptoms of which he<br /> then complained.... And here let me be per-<br />
      mitted to observe (lest blame might attach to those<br /> whose business it
      was to pay any particular attention<br /> to his cleanliness of person)
      that it was absolutely<br /> impossible to effect that purpose. Cleanliness
      ap-<br /> peared to make no part of his comfort; he seemed<br /> to have a
      singular aversion to soap and water; he<br /> would never ask to be washed,
      and when he was he<br /> would always make objections; and it was not un-<br />
      usual to wash and to dress him clean very much<br /> against his
      inclinations. In this deplorable state,<br /> with confirmed dropsy,
      attended with frequent cough,<br /> vomiting and hiccough, he continued
      growing from<br /> bad to worse till the morning of the 8th of June,<br />
      <br /> 505<br /> <br /> when he died. Though I may remark that during<br />
      the last three weeks of his life his situation was such<br /> that his
      decease was confidently expected every day,<br /> his ulcers having assumed
      a gangrenous appearance,<br /> being excessively fetid, and discolored
      blisters hav-<br /> ing taken place on the soles of his feet without any<br />
      ostensible cause, which baffled the usual attempts to<br /> arrest their
      progress; and when we consider his<br /> former habits, his advanced age,
      the feebleness of his<br /> constitution, his constant habit of using
      ardent spirits<br /> ad libitum till the commencement of his last illness,<br />
      so far from wondering that he died so soon, we are<br /> constrained to
      ask, How did he live so long? Con-<br /> cerning his conduct during his
      disease I have not<br /> much to remark, though the little I have may be<br />
      somewhat interesting. Mr. Paine professed to be<br /> above the fear of
      death, and a great part of his con-<br /> versation was principally
      directed to give the impres-<br /> sion that he was perfectly willing to
      leave this world,<br /> and yet some parts of his conduct were with
      difficulty<br /> reconcilable with his belief. In the first stages of his<br />
      illness he was satisfied to be left alone during the<br /> day, but he
      required some person to be with him at<br /> night, urging as his reason
      that he was afraid that<br /> he should die when unattended, and at this
      period<br /> his deportment and his principle seemed to be con-<br /> <br />
      506<br /> <br /> sistent; so much so that a stranger would judge from<br />
      some of the remarks he would make that he was an<br /> Infidel. I recollect
      being with him at night, watch-<br /> ing; he was very apprehensive of a
      speedy dissolu-<br /> tion, and suffered great distress of body, and
      perhaps<br /> of mind (for he was waiting the event of an applica-<br />
      tion to the Society of Friends for permission that his<br /> corpse might
      be deposited in their grave-ground, and<br /> had reason to believe that
      the request might be<br /> refused), when he remarked in these words, 'I
      think<br /> I can say what they made Jesus Christ to say&mdash;"My<br />
      God, my God! why hast thou forsaken me?" He<br /> went on to observe on the
      want of that respect which<br /> he conceived he merited, when I observed
      to him<br /> that I thought his corpse should be matter of least<br />
      concern to him; that those whom he would leave<br /> behind him would see
      that he was properly interred,<br /> and, further, that it would be of
      little consequence to<br /> me where I was deposited provided I was buried;<br />
      upon which he answered that he had nothing else to<br /> talk about, and
      that he would as lief talk of his death<br /> as of anything, but that he
      was not so indifferent<br /> about his corpse as I appeared to be.<br />
      <br /> "During the latter part of his life, though his con-<br /> versation
      was equivocal, his conduct was singular;<br /> he could not be left alone
      night or day; he not only<br /> <br /> 507<br /> <br /> required to have some
      person with him, but he must<br /> see that he or she was there, and would
      not allow<br /> his curtain to be closed at any time; and if, as it<br />
      would sometimes unavoidably happen, he was left<br /> alone, he would
      scream and halloo until some person<br /> came to him. When relief from
      pain would admit,<br /> he seemed thoughtful and contemplative, his eyes<br />
      being generally closed, and his hands folded upon<br /> his breast,
      although he never slept without the assist-<br /> ance of an anodyne. There
      was something remark-<br /> able in his conduct about this period (which
      comprises<br /> about two weeks immediately preceding his death),<br />
      particularly when we reflect that Thomas Paine was<br /> the author of the
      'Age of Reason.' He would call<br /> out during his paroxysms of distress,
      without inter-<br /> mission, 'O Lord help me! God help me! Jesus<br />
      Christ help me! Lord help me!' etc., repeating the<br /> same expressions
      without the least variation, in a<br /> tone of voice that would alarm the
      house. It was<br /> this conduct which induced me to think that he had<br />
      abandoned his former opinions, and I was more<br /> inclined to that belief
      when I understood from his<br /> nurse (who is a very serious and, I
      believe, pious<br /> woman), that he would occasionally inquire, when he<br />
      saw her engaged with a book, what she was reading,<br /> and, being
      answered, and at the same time asked<br /> <br /> 508<br /> <br /> whether she
      should read aloud, he assented, and<br /> would appear to give particular
      attention.<br /> <br /> "I took occasion during the nights of the fifth<br />
      and sixth of June to test the strength of his opinions<br /> respecting
      revelation. I purposely made him a very<br /> late visit; it was a time
      which seemed to suit exactly<br /> with my errand; it was midnight, he was
      in great<br /> distress, constantly exclaiming in the words above<br />
      mentioned, when, after a considerable preface, I<br /> addressed him in the
      following manner, the nurse<br /> being present: 'Mr. Paine, your opinions,
      by a large<br /> portion of the community, have been treated with<br />
      deference, you have never been in the habit of mix-<br /> ing in your
      conversation words of coarse meaning;<br /> you have never indulged in the
      practice of profane<br /> swearing; you must be sensible that we are ac-<br />
      quainted with your religious opinions as they are<br /> given to the world.
      What must we think of your<br /> present conduct? Why do you call upon
      Jesus<br /> Christ to help you? Do you believe that he can<br /> help you?
      Do you believe in the divinity of Jesus<br /> Christ? Come, now, answer me
      honestly. I want<br /> an answer from the lips of a dying man, for I verily<br />
      believe that you will not live twenty-four hours.' I<br /> waited some time
      at the end of every question; he<br /> did not answer, but ceased to
      exclaim in the above<br /> <br /> 509<br /> <br /> manner. Again I addressed
      him; 'Mr. Paine, you<br /> have not answered my questions; will you answer<br />
      them? Allow me to ask again, do you believe? or<br /> let me qualify the
      question, do you wish to believe<br /> that Jesus Christ is the Son of
      God?' After a pause<br /> of some minutes, he answered, 'I have no wish to<br />
      believe on that subject.' I then left him, and knew<br /> not whether he
      afterward spoke to any person on<br /> any subject, though he lived, as I
      before observed,<br /> till the morning of the 8th. Such conduct, under<br />
      usual circumstances, I conceive absolutely unaccount-<br /> able, though,
      with diffidence, I would remark, not so<br /> much so in the present
      instance; for though the first<br /> necessary and general result of
      conviction be a sin-<br /> cere wish to atone for evil committed, yet it
      may be<br /> a question worthy of able consideration whether<br /> excessive
      pride of opinion, consummate vanity, and<br /> inordinate self-love might
      not prevent or retard that<br /> otherwise natural consequence. For my own
      part,<br /> I believe that had not Thomas Paine been such a<br />
      distinguished Infidel he would have left less equivo-<br /> cal evidences
      of a change of opinion. Concerning<br /> the persons who visited Mr. Paine
      in his distress as<br /> his personal friends, I heard very little, though
      I may<br /> observe that their number was small, and of that<br /> number
      there were not wanting those who endeavor-<br /> <br /> 510<br /> <br /> ed to
      support him in his deistical opinions, and to<br /> encourage him to 'die
      like a man,' to 'hold fast his<br /> integrity,' lest Christians, or, as
      they were pleased to<br /> term them, hypocrites, might take advantage of
      his<br /> weakness, and furnish themselves with a weapon by<br /> which they
      might hope to destroy their glorious sys-<br /> tem of morals. Numbers
      visited him from motives<br /> of benevolence and Christian charity,
      endeavoring to<br /> effect a change of mind in respect to his religious<br />
      sentiments. The labor of such was apparently lost,<br /> and they pretty
      generally received such treatment<br /> from him as none but good men would
      risk a second<br /> time, though some of those persons called frequently."<br />
      The following testimony will be new to most of<br /> our readers. It is
      from a letter written by Bishop<br /> Fenwick (Roman Catholic Bishop of
      Boston), con-<br /> taining a full account of a visit which he paid to<br />
      Paine in his last illness. It was printed in the <i>United<br /> States
      Catholic Magazine</i> for 1846; in the <i>Catholic<br /> Herald</i> of
      Philadelphia, October 15, 1846; in a sup-<br /> plement to the <i>Hartford
      Courant</i>, October 23, 1847;<br /> and in <i>Littell's Living Age</i> for
      January 22, 1848,<br /> from which we copy. Bishop Fenwick writes:<br />
      <br /> "A short time before Paine died I was sent for by<br /> him. He was
      prompted to this by a poor Catholic<br /> woman who went to see him in his
      sickness, and<br /> <br /> 511<br /> <br /> who told him, among other things,
      that in his<br /> wretched condition if anybody could do him any<br /> good
      it would be a Roman Catholic priest. This<br /> woman was an American
      convert (formerly a Shak-<br /> ing Quakeress) whom I had received into the
      church<br /> but a few weeks before. She was the bearer of this<br />
      message to me from Paine. I stated this circum-<br /> stance to F.
      Kohlmann, at breakfast, and requested<br /> him to accompany me. After some
      solicitation on<br /> my part he agreed to do so? at which I was greatly<br />
      rejoiced, because I was at the time quite young and<br /> inexperienced in
      the ministry, and was glad to have<br /> his assistance, as I knew, from
      the great reputation<br /> of Paine, that I should have to do with one of
      the<br /> most impious as well as infamous of men. We<br /> shortly after
      set out for the house at Greenwich<br /> where Paine lodged, and on the way
      agreed on a<br /> mode of proceeding with him.<br /> <br /> "We arrived at
      the house; a decent-looking elderly<br /> woman (probably his housekeeper,)
      came to the<br /> door and inquired whether we were the Catholic<br />
      priests, for said she, 'Mr. Paine has been so much<br /> annoyed of late by
      other denominations calling upon<br /> him that he has left express orders
      with me to admit<br /> no one to-day but the clergymen of the Catholic<br />
      Church. Upon assuring her that we were Catholic<br /> <br /> 512<br /> <br />
      clergymen she opened the door and showed us into<br /> the parlor. She then
      left the room and shortly after<br /> returned to inform us that Paine was
      asleep, and, at<br /> the same time, expressed a wish that we would not<br />
      disturb him, 'for,' said she, 'he is always in a bad<br /> humor when
      roused out of his sleep. It is better we<br /> wait a little till he be
      awake.' We accordingly sat<br /> down and resolved to await a more
      favorable moment.<br /> 'Gentlemen,' said the lady, after having taken her<br />
      seat also, 'I really wish you may succeed with Mr.<br /> Paine, for he is
      laboring under great distress of mind<br /> ever since he was informed by
      his physicians that he<br /> cannot possibly live and must die shortly. He
      sent<br /> for you to-day because he was told that if any one<br /> could do
      him good you might. Possibly he may<br /> think you know of some remedy
      which his physicians<br /> are ignorant of. He is truly to be pitied. His
      cries<br /> when he is left alone are heart-rending. 'O Lord<br /> help me!'
      he will exclaim during his paroxysms of<br /> distress&mdash;'God help me&mdash;Jesus
      Christ help me!'<br /> repeating the same expressions without the least<br />
      variation, in a tone of voice that would alarm the<br /> house. Sometimes
      he will say, 'O God, what have<br /> I done to suffer so much!' then,
      shortly after, 'But<br /> there is no God,' and again a little after, 'Yet
      if<br /> there should be, what would become of me hereafter.'<br /> <br />
      513<br /> <br /> Thus he will continue for some time, when on a sud-<br />
      den he will scream, as if in terror and agony, and<br /> call out for me by
      name. On one of these occasions,<br /> which are very frequent, I went to
      him and inquired<br /> what he wanted. 'Stay with me,' he replied, 'for<br />
      God's sake, for I cannot bear to be left alone.' I<br /> then observed that
      I could not always be with him,<br /> as I had much to attend to in the
      house. 'Then,' said<br /> he, 'send even a child to stay with me, for it is
      a<br /> hell to be alone.' 'I never saw,' she concluded, 'a<br /> more
      unhappy, a more forsaken man. It seems he<br /> cannot reconcile himself to
      die.'<br /> <br /> "Such was the conversation of the woman who<br /> had
      received us, and who probably had been employ-<br /> ed to nurse and take
      care of him during his illness.<br /> She was a Protestant, yet seemed very
      desirous that<br /> we should afford him some relief in his state of<br />
      abandonment, bordering on complete despair. Hav-<br /> ing remained thus
      some time in the parlor, we at<br /> length heard a noise in the adjoining
      passage-way,<br /> which induced us to believe that Mr. Paine, who was<br />
      sick in that room, had awoke. We accordingly pro-<br /> posed to proceed
      thither, which was assented to by<br /> the woman, and she opened the door
      for us. On<br /> entering, we found him just getting out of his<br />
      slumber. A more wretched being in appearance I<br /> <br /> 514<br /> <br />
      never beheld. He was lying in a bed sufficiently<br /> decent of itself,
      but at present besmeared with filth;<br /> his look was that of a man
      greatly tortured in mind;<br /> his eyes haggard, his countenance
      forbidding, and<br /> his whole appearance that of one whose better days<br />
      had been one continued scene of debauch. His only<br /> nourishment at this
      time, as we were informed, was<br /> nothing more than milk punch, in which
      he indulged<br /> to the full extent of his weak state. He had par-<br />
      taken, undoubtedly, but very recently of it, as the<br /> sides and corners
      of his mouth exhibited very un-<br /> equivocal traces of it, as well as of
      blood, which had<br /> also followed in the track and left its mark on the<br />
      pillow. His face, to a certain extent, had also been<br /> besmeared with
      it."<br /> <br /> Immediately upon their making known the object<br /> of
      their visit, Paine interrupted the speaker by say-<br /> ing: "That's
      enough, sir; that's enough," and again<br /> interrupting him, "I see what
      you would be about.<br /> I wish to hear no more from you, sir. My mind is<br />
      made up on that subject. I look upon the whole of<br /> the Christian
      scheme to be a tissue of absurdities<br /> and lies, and Jesus Christ to be
      nothing more than a<br /> cunning knave and impostor." He drove them out<br />
      of the room, exclaiming: Away with you and your<br /> God, too; leave the
      room instantly; all that you<br /> <br /> 515<br /> <br /> have uttered are
      lies&mdash;filthy lies; and if I had a<br /> little more time I would prove
      it, as I did about<br /> your impostor, Jesus Christ."<br /> <br /> This, we
      think, will suffice. We have a mass of<br /> letters containing statements
      confirmatory of what<br /> we have published in regard to the life and
      death of<br /> Paine, but nothing more can be required.<br /> <br /> <br />

      SECOND REPLY.</b></big><br /> <br /> Peoria, Nov. 2d, 1877.<br /> <br /> To
      the Editor of the New York Observer:<br /> <br /> You ought to have honesty
      enough to admit that<br /> you did, in your paper of July 19th, offer to
      prove<br /> that the absurd story that Thomas Paine died in<br /> terror and
      agony on account of the religious opinions<br /> he had expressed, was
      true. You ought to have<br /> fairness enough to admit that you called upon
      me<br /> to deposit one thousand dollars with an honest man,<br /> that you
      might, by proving that Thomas Paine did<br /> die in terror, obtain the
      money.<br /> <br /> You ought to have honor enough to admit that<br /> you
      challenged me and that you commenced the<br /> controversy concerning
      Thomas Paine.<br /> <br /> You ought to have goodness enough to admit<br />
      that you were mistaken in the charges you made.<br /> <br /> You ought to
      have manhood enough to do what<br /> you falsely asserted that Thomas Paine
      did:&mdash;you<br /> ought to recant. You ought to admit publicly that<br />
      you slandered the dead; that you falsified history;<br /> that you defamed
      the defenceless; that you deliber-<br /> <br /> 517<br /> <br /> ately denied
      what you had published in your own<br /> paper. There is an old saying to
      the effect that<br /> open confession is good for the soul. To you is<br />
      presented a splendid opportunity of testing the truth<br /> of this saying.<br />
      <br /> Nothing has astonished me more than your lack<br /> of common honesty
      exhibited in this controversy. In<br /> your last, you quote from Dr. J. W.
      Francis. Why<br /> did you leave out that portion in which Dr. Francis<br />
      says <i>that Cheetham with settled malignity wrote the<br /> life of Paine?</i>
      Why did you leave out that part in<br /> which Dr. Francis says that
      Cheetham in the same<br /> way <i>slandered Alexander Hamilton and De Witt<br />
      Clinton?</i> Is it your business to suppress the truth?<br /> Why did you
      not publish the entire letter of Bishop<br /> Fenwick? Was it because it
      proved beyond all<br /> cavil that Thomas Paine did not recant? Was it<br />
      because in the light of that letter Mary Roscoe,<br /> Mary Hinsdale and
      Grant Thorburn appeared un-<br /> worthy of belief? Dr. J. W. Francis says
      in the<br /> same article from which you quoted, "<i>Paine clung to<br />
      his Infidelity until the last moment of his life!'</i> Why<br /> did you
      not publish that? It was the first line im-<br /> mediately above what you
      did quote. You must<br /> have seen it. Why did you suppress it? A lawyer,<br />
      doing a thing of this character, is denominated a<br /> <br /> 518<br />
      <br /> shyster. I do not know the appropriate word to<br /> designate a
      theologian guilty of such an act.<br /> <br /> You brought forward three
      witnesses, pretending<br /> to have personal knowledge about the life and
      death<br /> of Thomas Paine: Grant Thorburn, Mary Roscoe<br /> and Mary
      Hinsdale. In my reply I took the ground<br /> that Mary Roscoe and Mary
      Hinsdale must have<br /> been the same person. I thought it impossible that<br />
      Paine should have had a conversation with Mary<br /> Roscoe, and then one
      precisely like it with Mary<br /> Hinsdale. Acting upon this conviction, I
      proceeded<br /> to show that the conversation never could have hap-<br />
      pened, that it was absurdly false to say that Paine<br /> asked the opinion
      of a girl as to his works who had<br /> never read but little of them. I
      then showed by the<br /> testimony of William Cobbett, that he visited Mary<br />
      Hinsdale in 1819, taking with him a statement con-<br /> cerning the
      recantation of Paine, given him by Mr.<br /> Collins, and that upon being
      shown this statement<br /> she said that "it was so long ago that she could
      not<br /> speak positively to any part of the matter&mdash;that she<br />
      would not say any part of the paper was true." At<br /> that time she knew
      nothing, and remembered noth-<br /> ing. I also showed that she was a kind
      of standing<br /> witness to prove that others recanted. Willett Hicks<br />
      denounced her as unworthy of belief.<br /> <br /> 519<br /> <br /> To-day the
      following from the New York <i>World</i><br /> was received, showing that I
      was right in my<br /> conjecture:<br /> <br /> <br /> Tom Paine's Death-Bed.<br />
      <br /> <i>To the Editor of the World</i>:<br /> <br /> Sir: I see by your
      paper that Bob Ingersoll dis-<br /> credits Mary Hinsdale's story of the
      scenes which<br /> occurred at the death-bed of Thomas Paine. No<br /> one
      who knew that good lady would for one moment<br /> doubt her veracity or
      question her testimony. Both<br /> she and her husband were Quaker
      preachers, and<br /> well known and respected inhabitants of New York<br />
      City, <i>Ingersoll is right in his conjecture that Mary<br /> Roscoe and
      Mary Hinsdale was the same person</i>. Her<br /> maiden name was Roscoe,
      and she married Henry<br /> Hinsdale. My mother was a Roscoe, a niece of<br />
      Mary Roscoe, and lived with her for some time. I<br /> have heard her
      relate the story of Tom Paine's dying<br /> remorse, as told her by her
      aunt, who was a witness<br /> to it. She says (in a letter I have just
      received from<br /> her), "he (Tom Paine) suffered fearfully from remorse,<br />
      and renounced his Infidel principles, calling on God<br /> to forgive him,
      and wishing his pamphlets and books<br /> to be burned, saying he could not
      die in peace until<br /> it was done." (Rev.) A. W. Cornell.<br /> <br />
      Harpersville, New York.<br /> <br /> 520<br /> <br /> You will notice that the
      testimony of Mary Hins-<br /> dale has been drawing interest since 1809,
      and has<br /> materially increased. If Paine "suffered fearfully<br /> from
      remorse, renounced his Infidel opinions and<br /> called on God to forgive
      him," it is hardly generous<br /> for the Christian world to fasten the
      fangs of malice<br /> in the flesh of his reputation.<br /> <br /> So Mary
      Roscoe was Mary Hinsdale, and as<br /> Mary Hinsdale has been shown by her
      own admis-<br /> sion to Mr. Cobbett to have known nothing of the<br />
      matter; and as Mary Hinsdale was not, according to<br /> Willet Hicks,
      worthy of belief&mdash;as she told a false-<br /> hood of the same kind
      about Mary Lockwood, and<br /> was, according to Mr. Collins, addicted to
      the use of<br /> opium&mdash;this disposes of her and her testimony.<br />
      <br /> There remains upon the stand Grant Thorburn.<br /> Concerning this
      witness, I received, yesterday, from<br /> the eminent biographer and
      essayist, James Parton,<br /> the following epistle:<br /> <br />
      Newburyport, Mass.<br /> <br /> Col. R. G. Ingersoll:<br /> <br /> Touching
      Grant Thorburn, I personally know him<br /> to have been a dishonest man.
      At the age of ninety-<br /> two he copied, with trembling hand, a piece
      from a<br /> newspaper and brought it to the office of the <i>Home<br />
      Journal, as his own</i>. It was I who received it and<br /> <br /> 521<br />
      <br /> detected the deliberate forgery. If you are ever go-<br /> ing to
      continue this subject, I will give you the exact<br /> facts.<br /> <br />
      Fervently yours,<br /> <br /> James Parton.<br /> <br /> After this, you are
      welcome to what remains of<br /> Grant Thorburn.<br /> <br /> There is one
      thing that I have noticed during this<br /> controversy regarding Thomas
      Paine. In no instance<br /> that I now call to mind has any Christian
      writer<br /> spoken respectfully of Mr. Paine. All have taken<br />
      particular pains to call him "Tom" Paine. Is it not<br /> a little strange
      that religion should make men so<br /> coarse and ill-mannered?<br /> <br />
      I have often wondered what these same gentle-<br /> men would say if I
      should speak of the men eminent<br /> in the annals of Christianity in the
      same way. What<br /> would they say if I should write about "Tim"<br />
      Dwight, old "Ad" Clark, "Tom" Scott, "Jim"<br /> McKnight, "Bill" Hamilton,
      "Dick" Whately, "Bill"<br /> Paley, and "Jack" Calvin?<br /> <br /> They
      would <i>say</i> of me then, just what I <i>think</i> of<br /> them now.<br />
      <br /> Even if we have religion, do not let us try to get<br /> along
      without good manners. Rudeness is exceed-<br /> ingly unbecoming, even in a
      saint. Persons who<br /> <br /> 522<br /> <br /> forgive their enemies ought,
      to say the least, to<br /> treat with politeness those who have never
      injured<br /> them.<br /> <br /> It is exceedingly gratifying to me that I
      have com-<br /> pelled you to say that "Paine died a blaspheming<br />
      Infidel." Hereafter it is to be hoped nothing will be<br /> heard about his
      having recanted. As an answer to<br /> such slander his friends can
      confidently quote the<br /> following from the <i>New York Observer</i> of
      November<br /> ist, 1877:<br /> <br /> "WE HAVE NEVER STATED IN ANY FORM, NOR<br />
      HAVE WE EVER SUPPOSED THAT PAINE ACTUALLY RE-<br /> NOUNCED HIS INFIDELITY.
      THE ACCOUNTS AGREE IN<br /> STATING THAT HE DIED A BLASPHEMING INFIDEL."<br />
      <br /> This for all coming time will refute the slanders of<br /> the
      churches yet to be.<br /> <br /> Right here allow me to ask: If you never
      supposed<br /> that Paine renounced his Infidelity, why did you try<br /> to
      prove by Mary Hinsdale that which you believed<br /> to be untrue?<br />
      <br /> From the bottom of my heart I thank myself for<br /> having compelled
      you to admit that Thomas Paine<br /> did not recant.<br /> <br /> For the
      purpose of verifying your own admission<br /> concerning the death of Mr.
      Paine, permit me to call<br /> your attention to the following affidavit:<br />
      <br /> 523<br /> <br /> Wabash, Indiana, October 27, 1877.<br /> <br /> Col. R.
      G. Ingersoll:<br /> <br /> Dear Sir: The following statement of facts is at<br />
      your disposal. In the year 1833 Willet Hicks made<br /> a visit to Indiana
      and stayed over night at my father's<br /> house, four miles east of
      Richmond. In the morn-<br /> ing at breakfast my mother asked Willet Hicks
      the<br /> following questions:<br /> <br /> "Was thee with Thomas Paine
      during his last<br /> sickness?"<br /> <br /> Mr. Hicks said: "I was with him
      every day dur-<br /> ing the latter part of his last sickness."<br /> <br />
      "Did he express any regret in regard to writing<br /> the 'Age of Reason,'
      as the published accounts say<br /> he did&mdash;those accounts that have
      the credit of ema-<br /> nating from his Catholic housekeeper?"<br /> <br />
      Mr. Hicks replied: "He did not in any way by<br /> word or action."<br />
      <br /> "Did he call on God or Jesus Christ, asking either<br /> of them to
      forgive his sins, or did he curse them or<br /> either of them?"<br /> <br />
      Mr. Hicks answered: "He did not. He died as<br /> easy as any one I ever
      saw die, and I have seen<br /> many die in my time." William B Barnes.<br />
      <br /> Subscribed and sworn to before me Oct. 27, 1877.<br /> <br /> Warren
      Bigler, Notary Public.<br /> <br /> 524<br /> <br /> You say in your last that
      "Thomas Paine was<br /> abandoned of God." So far as this controversy is<br />
      concerned, it seems to me that in that sentence you<br /> have most
      graphically described your own condi-<br /> tion.<br /> <br /> Wishing you
      success in all honest undertakings, I<br /> remain,<br /> <br /> Yours truly,<br />
      <br /> Robert G. Ingersoll.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
